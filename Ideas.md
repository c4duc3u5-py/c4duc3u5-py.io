1. Auto-Generated Niche Blog — AI writes SEO blog posts like "Best Vintage Cameras Under $100" or "How to Identify Rare Stamps" and each post links to your eBay listings. You host it on something free like GitHub Pages or Cloudflare Pages. You never touch it — a pipeline just generates posts from your inventory data. Google indexes them, people find them, click through to your listings. Zero social media required.

2. Google Shopping / Free Listings Feed — Google lets you list products for free on Google Shopping. An AI pipeline could take your eBay inventory, reformat it into a Google Merchant Center feed, and keep it synced automatically. People search Google for products → your stuff shows up → they click through to eBay. No social media, no ad spend.

3. Pinterest Auto-Pinner — I know you said no social media, but hear me out: Pinterest isn't really "social" — it's a visual search engine. An AI tool could auto-generate pins from your product photos (add text overlays, resize, write descriptions) and post them to a board automatically. You never interact with anyone. It just generates search-indexed images that link to your listings. Very hands-off.
