This specific item is listed as Pre-owned on eBay for £14.99 and sits in the DIY & Tools category for miniature painters who need a near-complete paint kit without paying full retail.</p><p><img src=/images/products/buy-warhammer-age-of-sigmar-stormcast-eternals-paint-set---o-7c05fe/Warhammer-Age-of-Sigmar-Stormcast-Eterna.webp alt="Warhammer Age of Sigmar Stormcast Eternals Paint Set - Opened - Complete"></p><p><a href=https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/227204419061>Warhammer Age of Sigmar Stormcast Eternals Paint Set - Opened - Complete</a> — Price: £14.99. Condition: Pre-owned. Shipping: see the eBay listing for postage costs and delivery estimates.</p><h3 id=what-this-specific-paint-set-contains-and-why-it-matters>What this specific paint set contains and why it matters</h3><p>The listing describes the set as opened but complete. That means all original paint pots and any included accessories (brushes, guide cards) are present according to the seller. The paints are almost certainly standard Citadel-style 12 ml acrylic pots used for Warhammer models. That format matters: 12 ml pots are easy to store, mix, and re-seal, and they work with standard hobby brushes and wet palettes.</p><p>Why this set is worth attention:</p><ul><li>It gives you a Stormcast-focused palette built for Age of Sigmar paints, which speeds up painting a Stormcast army.</li><li>The pots being pre-used but complete means you can start painting immediately without buying individual colours.</li><li>At £14.99, this listing is pitched to hobbyists who want a working paint kit for table-top armies or a painting practice set.</li></ul><h3 id=materials-features-and-practical-use-cases>Materials, features and practical use cases</h3><p>This specific set consists of water-based acrylic hobby paints in small screw-top pots. Use cases for this item include:</p><ul><li>Basecoating and layering Stormcast miniatures with the pre-selected palette.</li><li>Practicing blending and highlights on leftover sprues or test miniatures.</li><li>Supplementing an existing paint stash with Stormcast-specific shades.</li></ul><p>Features to note for this item:</p><ul><li>Paint format: standard Citadel-style pots (12 ml typical for Warhammer paints). That makes the set compatible with hobby thinners, wet palettes, and Citadel bases/mediums.</li><li>Opacity and finish: the set’s paints, being intended for miniatures, should offer a mix of base, layer and shade finishes suitable for metallics and armour.</li><li>Compact storage: the pots fit hobby trays and drawer organisers used by miniature painters.</li></ul><h3 id=condition-pre-owned--what-that-actually-means-for-this-listing>Condition: Pre-owned — what that actually means for this listing</h3><p>This specific item is listed as Pre-owned (opened). The seller states the set is complete, which usually means every original pot is present and caps are included. Pre-owned here carries a few practical implications:</p><ul><li>Expect some paint on the rims and possible wear on labels.</li><li>Some pots may have reduced fill levels compared to brand new bottles.</li><li>Caps should reseal, but older or sticky lids can allow partial drying; not all pots will be pristine.</li></ul><p>Because the listing is opened, ask the seller for close-up photos of each pot and the inside of the caps if you want to assess dryness. This is a Pre-owned item priced at £14.99 — a good starting point if you’re comfortable with slight cosmetic wear for a working paint set.</p><h3 id=what-to-check-before-buying-this-specific-listing>What to check before buying this specific listing</h3><ul><li>Request photos of every pot’s top and label to confirm colours and fill levels.</li><li>Ask the seller to show any included accessories (brushes, instructions, palette) to confirm &ldquo;complete&rdquo;.</li><li>Confirm whether any pots are partially dried or have hardened paint in the nozzle.</li><li>Check the seller’s postage and returns policy on the eBay listing for exact shipping costs and handling times.</li><li>Ask for the approximate age of the paint set; older pots can skin over but are often salvageable with a bit of water and a stir.</li></ul><p>These checks are specific to this eBay listing and will reduce the chance of receiving unusable pots.</p><h3 id=price-comparison-how-1499-stacks-up>Price comparison: how £14.99 stacks up</h3><p>A new Stormcast-specific paint set or equivalent bundle from Games Workshop / Citadel usually retails around £25–£35 depending on included colours and promotional packaging. Individual Citadel pots commonly cost between £2.50–£3.50 each when bought separately. Priced at £14.99 for a Pre-owned, opened but complete set, this listing sits at roughly half the lower end of new-set pricing — a sensible saving if the pots are in usable condition. For someone building a Stormcast force incrementally, this is a cost-effective top-up compared with buying multiple single pots at full price.</p><h3 id=care-tips-if-you-buy-this-specific-pre-owned-set>Care tips if you buy this specific Pre-owned set</h3><ul><li>When you receive the set, open and stir each pot immediately; use a dedicated hobby stirrer or toothpick.</li><li>Store the pots upright in a cool, dry place to avoid cap leaks.</li><li>Use a wet palette to prolong working life after opening.</li><li>If lids are sticky, soak them briefly in warm water to dissolve dried paint before resealing.</li></ul><p>These steps will help you get the most from this exact pre-owned paint set.</p><h3 id=verdict--who-should-buy-this-set-and-when-to-skip-it>Verdict — who should buy this set and when to skip it</h3><p>Best overall pick: This Warhammer Age of Sigmar Stormcast Eternals Paint Set — Opened — Complete at £14.99 is the best overall pick for hobbyists who want a Stormcast palette on a budget and are comfortable with pre-owned paints. Buy this if you want to save money and don’t need brand-new, factory-sealed pots.</p><p>Skip this listing if you require brand-new sealed pots for resale, competition use, or if you cannot accept any possibility of dried or partially used paints. Also skip if the seller cannot provide clear photos of each pot and confirmation that the set is complete.</p><h3 id=final-recommendation-and-where-to-buy>Final recommendation and where to buy</h3><p>If you want a ready Stormcast palette for painting now, this specific Pre-owned set at £14.99 is a practical bargain — provided you confirm pot condition with the seller. It’s targeted at DIY & Tools buyers who need Warhammer Age of Sigmar paints without paying full retail.</p><p>View or buy the listing here: <a href=https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/227204419061>Warhammer Age of Sigmar Stormcast Eternals Paint Set - Opened - Complete</a></p><p>Price: £14.99.
