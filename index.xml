Right now there are a few eye-catching pheasant-themed pieces listed that mix retro charm with practical use. These are affordable, collectible, and great for whiskey, beer, or as decorative accents — especially if you like gold-rimmed details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are three current listings in the same price bracket that are worth a look. Each is listed at $17.69 and ships internationally for free. I’ve included the exact eBay links so you can buy glassware &amp;amp; drinkware directly.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Computers, Tablets &amp; Network Hardware: New vs Used Deals</title><link>https://c4duc3u5-py.github.io/c4duc3u5-py.io/computers-tablets-network-hardware-new-vs-used-deals/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 19:05:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://c4duc3u5-py.github.io/c4duc3u5-py.io/computers-tablets-network-hardware-new-vs-used-deals/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="new-vs-used-computers-tablets--network-hardware-which-is-the-better-deal"&gt;New vs Used Computers, Tablets &amp;amp; Network Hardware: Which Is the Better Deal?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re shopping in the computers, tablets &amp;amp; network hardware category on a budget, there are solid options both new and pre-owned. Small accessories and peripherals often do just as well used, while routers and scanners may benefit from buying new or lightly used with a return window. Below I compare four real listings in the $14–$67 range so you can decide what to buy now, whether you want cheap stands, a portable scanner, or a reliable router.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Buy Collectibles Online: Best Affordable Collectibles</title><link>https://c4duc3u5-py.github.io/c4duc3u5-py.io/buy-collectibles-online-best-affordable-collectibles/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 19:05:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://c4duc3u5-py.github.io/c4duc3u5-py.io/buy-collectibles-online-best-affordable-collectibles/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="the-ultimate-guide-to-buying-collectibles-online"&gt;The Ultimate Guide to Buying Collectibles Online&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding statement pieces for your bar or kitchen doesn’t have to cost a lot. These three vintage-style pheasant glasses bring personality, a touch of gold gilt, and genuine mid-century charm — all at a budget-friendly price. They’re great if you collect unique glasses, want a single replacement piece, or are building a matched set gradually with multibuy listings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three listings below are priced at $17.69 and include free international shipping. Each listing is for a single glass (x1) and marked as multibuy so you can add more later if you want a full set.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Best Computers, Tablets &amp; Network Hardware Deals This Week</title><link>https://c4duc3u5-py.github.io/c4duc3u5-py.io/best-computers-tablets-network-hardware-deals-this-week/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 19:04:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://c4duc3u5-py.github.io/c4duc3u5-py.io/best-computers-tablets-network-hardware-deals-this-week/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="best-computers-tablets--network-hardware-deals-this-week"&gt;Best Computers, Tablets &amp;amp; Network Hardware Deals This Week&lt;/h2&gt;
