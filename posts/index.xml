Price: $44,601.00 — Condition: Zcela nový (brand new) — Shipping: calculated at checkout (see listing)&lt;br&gt;
This luxury cocktail set stands out because of its presentation and apparent high-end finish (likely plated stainless steel or copper). It’s worth buying if you’re a collector or setting up a premium bar display; check for exact materials (stainless vs. copper plating), capacities of the shaker parts, and whether it includes a strainer and jigger. Red flag: the six-figure markup versus typical bar sets — verify seller feedback and provenance before committing.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Best Glassware &amp; Drinkware: Pheasant Gold Glasses Deals</title><link>https://c4duc3u5-py.github.io/c4duc3u5-py.io/best-glassware-drinkware-pheasant-gold-glasses-deals/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 19:06:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://c4duc3u5-py.github.io/c4duc3u5-py.io/best-glassware-drinkware-pheasant-gold-glasses-deals/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="whats-new-in-glassware--drinkware--latest-listings"&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s New in Glassware &amp;amp; Drinkware — Latest Listings&lt;/h2&gt;

They’re great if you collect unique glasses, want a single replacement piece, or are building a matched set gradually with multibuy listings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three listings below are priced at $17.69 and include free international shipping.
