## [Mr Potato Head 3D Mug 7 Face Pieces Ceramic Toy Story - New in Box](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/227206341105)  
![Mr Potato Head 3D Mug](/images/products/best-affordable-tech-electronics-you-can-buy-right-now-4c81da/Mr-Potato-Head-3D-Mug.webp)

- Price: £15.99  
- Condition: New (other)  
- Shipping: see eBay listing for postage and dispatch details

Why buy it: This is a ceramic novelty mug that doubles as a collectible. The removable plastic face-pieces (7 pieces) let you customise the cup — great for families or as a desk conversation starter. It’s an easy gift for Toy Story fans or for anyone who wants a playful mug on their desk.

What you should know: The mug is ceramic with small plastic accessories. Avoid the dishwasher — hand wash the ceramic and remove the plastic parts first to prevent warping or losing tiny pieces. Typical capacity is around 300–350ml (standard mug size), so it’s fine for coffee or tea but not a travel thermos.

Best use cases: desk ornament and beverage mug, kid-friendly gift, display piece for collectors. Watch for small parts if buying for young children.

## [GOKEDA Aluminium Laptop Stand Ergonomic Computer Desk Stand - New](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/227204576588)  
![GOKEDA Aluminium Laptop Stand](/images/products/best-affordable-tech-electronics-you-can-buy-right-now-4c81da/GOKEDA-Aluminium-Laptop-Stand.webp)

- Price: £19.99  
- Condition: Brand new  
- Shipping: see eBay listing for postage and dispatch details

Why buy it: This lightweight aluminium stand raises a laptop to a more ergonomic height, reducing neck strain and improving airflow. Good build-materials (anodised aluminium) mean it’s sturdy but portable. At this price it’s a big-win for home workers or students using a laptop for long periods.

Key features and dimensions: Typically made from CNC-cut aluminium alloy, non-slip silicone pads on contact points, collapsible design for travel. Fits most 11–17-inch laptops. Stands usually lift the rear 10–20cm depending on angle — check the listing photos for exact size.

Practical advice: Use with an external keyboard and mouse for proper ergonomics. Clean with a damp microfiber cloth; avoid abrasive cleaners that can remove anodised finish. Check weight capacity on the listing if you run a heavy workstation or use a 17-inch gaming laptop.

Best use cases: home office, hybrid workers, café working, laptop cooling (improved airflow underneath).

## [Bike Phone Mount Frame Bag Touch Screen MTB Road Cycling Holder - New](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/227204918144)  
![Bike Phone Mount Frame Bag](/images/products/best-affordable-tech-electronics-you-can-buy-right-now-4c81da/Bike-Phone-Mount-Frame-Bag.webp)

- Price: £13.99  
- Condition: Brand new  
- Shipping: see eBay listing for postage and dispatch details

Why buy it: If you use your phone for navigation, Strava, or music while cycling, a frame-mounted touch-screen bag keeps the device visible and accessible. At £13.99 this is a low-cost way to add convenience and protection against light rain and road dust.

Materials and fit: Usually made from 600D Oxford fabric with TPU clear touch window and Velcro straps for frame attachment. Fits most phones up to around 6.5 inches (check the seller’s internal dimensions). The bag has a zippered compartment for keys and a small power bank.

Practical tips: Ensure the Velcro straps are looped around a solid part of the frame, not just cables. Test touchscreen response through the TPU window before a long ride. For heavy rain, keep the phone in a sealed inner pouch — the TPU window handles splashes but isn’t always fully waterproof.

Best use cases: MTB and road cycling, commuter bikes, long rides where navigation matters.

## [TP-Link Archer VR600 AC1600 Wireless Gigabit VDSL/ADSL Modem Router 1600Mbps](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/227215516428)  
![TP-Link Archer VR600 AC1600](/images/products/best-affordable-tech-electronics-you-can-buy-right-now-4c81da/TP-Link-Archer-VR600-AC1600.webp)

- Price: £40.00  
- Condition: Opened – never used  
- Shipping: see eBay listing for postage and dispatch details

Why buy it: For £40, this is the most impactful piece of tech in the list. The Archer VR600 is an AC1600 dual-band modem router that supports VDSL/ADSL connections and offers Gigabit LAN ports — ideal if you need a single device for fibre-to-the-cabinet + VDSL or older ADSL lines.

Key specs that matter: AC1600 (approx. 300Mbps on 2.4GHz + 1300Mbps on 5GHz), VDSL2/ADSL2+ modem built-in, multiple Gigabit LAN ports (typ. 4), external antennas for range. Opened but unused condition usually means full functionality and likely includes original packaging and power adapter.

Setup and compatibility notes: Use the web-based setup or TP-Link Tether app. If switching from a provider-supplied router, check whether ISP-specific firmware/release settings are required (some ISPs lock VOIP or VLAN settings). If you rely on phone line VOIP, confirm the phone-port functionality.

Care and security: Keep firmware updated via TP-Link’s support pages. Change the default admin password and set a guest Wi‑Fi network for visitors. Mount away from heat sources and keep antennas upright for best coverage.

Best use cases: small flats, home offices, streaming and light gaming on multiple devices.

## What to look for when you buy tech & electronics online (practical checklist)

- Seller reputation and returns: Always check the seller’s feedback percentage and read recent reviews. For electronics, a 30-day return or warranty is worth a few pounds extra.  
- Condition and accessories: “Opened – never used” can be fine, but confirm all accessories (power lead, manual, original box) are included. For brand-new items, check if packaging is labelled as “retail sealed.”  
- Compatibility: For routers, check VDSL/ADSL support and VLAN/PPPoE settings if your ISP needs them. For stands and mounts, check stated dimensions vs your device size.  
- Materials and durability: Aluminium is better for stands if you want rigidity; 600D Oxford fabric or TPU is best for bike bags. For novelty items with small parts, prioritise quality plastics that clip firmly.  
- Shipping and delivery: Look at dispatch times and postage costs. Faster dispatch is worth paying if you need the item quickly. International returns can be costly — prefer UK sellers for easier returns.  
- Care and cleaning: Electronics need dry, dust-free environments. For fabric or TPU bags, occasional soap-and-water cleaning keeps them functional. For ceramic and novelty items, hand washing prevents damage to decals and small parts.  
- Security (routers): Change default passwords, enable WPA2/WPA3, and keep firmware current.

## Final verdict — best overall pick and quick links

All four items have clear use-cases: the mug (£15.99, new), the laptop stand (£19.99, brand new), the bike phone mount (£13.99, brand new) and the TP‑Link Archer VR600 (£40.00, opened — never used). My top pick is the TP‑Link Archer VR600 AC1600. For £40 you’re getting a genuine upgrade to home networking: built-in VDSL modem, dual-band Wi‑Fi, and Gigabit ports. It delivers the widest practical benefit of the group — faster, more reliable internet for streaming, remote work, and multiple devices.
