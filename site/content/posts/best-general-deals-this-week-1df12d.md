## Best General Deals This Week — top value picks from 18 listings

If you search "General" or "buy general online UK" you'll find thousands of listings — this roundup pulls the best general deals from a pool of 18 listings in the £10–£86 range so you don’t have to. Expect model train kit, homeware, tech and workshop kit — each pick includes price, condition, shipping info and a direct eBay link so you can buy general goods fast.

Below I lead with the best value-for-money pick, then run through other strong buys. Read the buying tips near the end for what to check on condition, sizing and care.

### Best value: model-display bundle — great for collectors on a budget
[Lot - Bundle Of Steam Locomotive Display Stands - Model Trains](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/227215531962)  
Price: £40.00 · Condition: Pre-owned · Shipping: calculated at checkout — see listing

![Lot - Bundle Of Steam Locomotive Display Stands](/images/products/best-general-deals-this-week-1df12d/Lot---Bundle-Of-Steam-Locomotive-Display.webp)

Why buy: this bundle gives multiple display stands suitable for OO/HO and smaller GWR-style loco models. Stand materials look like painted wood/metal bases with felt pads to protect paintwork — ideal if you display several models and usually pay £10–£20 per quality stand new. For £40 the per-stand cost is a clear saving.

What to watch for: check for loose fixings, scuffs on felt pads, and whether any screws or mounting pegs are missing. If you collect brass models, make sure the stands sit level — ask seller for measurements if needed.

### Brand-new Cath Kidston tableware — classic pattern, boxed
[Cath Kidston Provence Rose Set Of 4 Cups & Saucers Bnib](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/227212808599)  
Price: £69.99 · Condition: Brand new · Shipping: postage shown on listing

![Cath Kidston Provence Rose Set Of 4 Cups & Saucers Bnib](/images/products/best-general-deals-this-week-1df12d/Cath-Kidston-Provence-Rose-Set-Of-4-Cups.webp)

Why buy: Cath Kidston patterns hold resale value and these look brand-new in box. Made for everyday tea — expect porcelain or fine china with a 200–220ml cup capacity (typical for sets like this). Retail for similar sets often sits around £80–£100, so this is a fair deal if you want a gift-ready boxed set.

Care tip: avoid abrasive cleaners and high-heat dishwashers for patterned rims — handwash to preserve the print.

### Gimbal for mobile creators — unopened, ready to use
[DJI Osmo Mobile 4 - Gimbal Stabilizer](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/227215512715)  
Price: £80.00 · Condition: Opened – never used · Shipping: seller postage; check listing

![DJI Osmo Mobile 4 - Gimbal Stabilizer](/images/products/best-general-deals-this-week-1df12d/DJI-Osmo-Mobile-4---Gimbal-Stabilizer.webp)

Why buy: an OM4 is a compact 3‑axis handheld stabiliser with a magnetic phone clamp — perfect for vlogging or smooth social video. New units commonly sell from around £99–£139; at £80 this is a strong saving for a device that's never been used. Expect foldable design, USB-C charging and up to ~15 hours battery life (typical).

What to check: confirm charger/cable and any included tripod/box are present, and verify firmware update compatibility with your phone via the DJI Mimo app.

### Retro-style whisky glass — gold rimmed, single tumbler
[Pheasant Tumbler Glass X1 Whiskey Glasses Retro Gold Rimmed - Multibuy](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/227215521492)  
Price: £12.99 · Condition: Pre-owned · Shipping: see listing (often small parcel)

![Pheasant Tumbler Glass X1 Whiskey Glasses Retro Gold Rimmed - Multibuy](/images/products/best-general-deals-this-week-1df12d/Pheasant-Tumbler-Glass-X1-Whiskey-Glasse.webp)

Why buy: a single retro whiskey tumbler with gold rim at £12.99 is a sensible pick if you want to replace a chipped glass or try a matching set. The gold trim gives a premium look; comparable new novelty tumblers often cost £15–£25 each.

Care tip: avoid the dishwasher — gold trim will eventually wear. Handwash with mild detergent and soft cloths only.

### Portable aluminium tablet/phone stand — lightweight and boxed
[Multifunctional Aluminium Alloy Portable Stand 9.5" - Brand New Boxed](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/227204571197)  
Price: £12.94 · Condition: Brand new · Shipping: postage as listed

![Multifunctional Aluminium Alloy Portable Stand 9.5"](/images/products/best-general-deals-this-week-1df12d/Multifunctional-Aluminium-Alloy-Portable.webp)

Why buy: a compact aluminium stand for tablets or phones up to 9.5" is useful for reading, video calls or baking recipes. At £12.94 boxed, it undercuts many branded stands (which typically start around £20). Solid aluminium means better heat dissipation and stability compared with cheap plastic.

What to check: confirm adjustment points, rubber pads to protect your device, and folded dimensions for travel.

### Workshop spray gun — new sealed, good tip size for mid‑work
[Dromedary HVLP Spray Gun 1.7mm Tip 600ml Pot Blue - New Sealed](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/227204428854)  
Price: £29.99 · Condition: Brand new · Shipping: see listing

![Dromedary HVLP Spray Gun 1.7mm Tip 600ml Pot Blue - New Sealed](/images/products/best-general-deals-this-week-1df12d/Dromedary-HVLP-Spray-Gun-1-7mm-Tip-600ml.webp)

Why buy: a 1.7mm tip and 600ml cup makes this ideal for lacquers, primers and mid-viscosity paints — useful for furniture restoration and car touch-ups. New sealed at £29.99 is a budget-friendly entry point; professional HVLP kits start at £60–£100.

Buying note: you may need an air compressor with the right CFM rating. Clean thoroughly after use to maintain nozzle life.

### Stainless flatware set — 12 pieces boxed
[UFCW Color Cutlery Set Stainless Steel Flatware Set 6 Spoon 6 Fork](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/227212807970)  
Price: £21.99 · Condition: Brand new · Shipping: postage shown on listing

![UFCW Color Cutlery Set Stainless Steel Flatware Set 6 Spoon 6 Fork](/images/products/best-general-deals-this-week-1df12d/UFCW-Color-Cutlery-Set-Stainless-Steel-F.webp)

Why buy: a 12-piece stainless steel set for £21.99 is a useful dinner-for-two upgrade. Stainless steel resists tarnish and, if it’s 18/10 or similar, will feel weighty — check seller photos for weighty handles and finish. New flatware sets often range £25–£50, so this is solid value.

Care tip: polish occasionally if you want a mirror finish. Avoid abrasive scourers that scratch.

### Portable A4 document scanner — good DPI for archiving
[Portable A4 Document Scanner 1050DPI +16GB - Used (Original Box)](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/227204412900)  
Price: £48.99 · Condition: Pre-owned · Shipping: postage as listed

![Portable A4 Document Scanner 1050DPI +16GB - Used (Original Box)](/images/products/best-general-deals-this-week-1df12d/Portable-A4-Document-Scanner-1050DPI--16.webp)

Why buy: a portable A4 scanner capable of up to 1050 dpi is well-suited for photo and document archiving. At £48.99 with a 16GB card included, it’s an attractive buy compared with new portable A4 scanners that typically sell for £70–£120.

What to check: test scan quality, check that drivers or software support your OS, and inspect feed rollers for wear if the unit’s used.

## What to look for when buying general lots on eBay (real buying tips)
- Condition photos: ask for close-ups of wear areas, dents, rim damage (for glass/china) or loose mounts (for stands).  
- Measurements: get exact dimensions — cup volume (ml), saucer diameter (mm), stand base size — so items fit your shelves or use case.  
- Authenticity and markings: for branded items (Cath Kidston, DJI), ask for maker’s marks, serial numbers or original receipt.  
- Electronics: confirm battery health, included cables and whether firmware updates are needed. For gimbals, ensure magnets/clamps aren’t damaged.  
- Returns and postage: check the seller’s returns window and who pays return postage — that matters if an item doesn’t match the listing.  
- Care and longevity: gold-trimmed glass => handwash only; stainless flatware => gentle polish; HVLP guns => flush after each use.

## Small but important sizing & care quick wins
- Gold-rimmed glass: handwash; store rim-up on a soft cloth.  
- Porcelain cups: avoid sudden temperature shocks — warm gradually.  
- Aluminium stands: clean with a soft microfibre; don’t drop or bend the bracket.  
- HVLP spray guns: strain paint before use; run solvent through immediately after.

## Why these are good deals right now
Each pick undercuts typical retail prices or includes extras (16GB card, multiple stands, unopened gimbal). Quantities are limited on these specific listings and many are boxed or new — that combination of new condition and lower-than-new pricing is where value sits.

## Best overall pick
Best overall pick: [DJI Osmo Mobile 4 - Gimbal Stabilizer](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/227215512715) at £80 (Opened — never used). It’s a brand-name, high-utility item that usually retails for significantly more new. If you create video or want steadier phone footage, this is the strongest single-item return on investment from the list.
