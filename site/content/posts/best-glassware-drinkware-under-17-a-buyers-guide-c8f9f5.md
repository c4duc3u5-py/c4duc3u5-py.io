# Best Glassware & Drinkware Under $17 — A Buyer's Guide

Finding statement pieces for your bar or kitchen doesn’t have to cost a lot. These three vintage-style pheasant glasses bring personality, a touch of gold gilt, and genuine mid-century charm — all at a budget-friendly price. They’re great if you collect unique glasses, want a single replacement piece, or are building a matched set gradually with multibuy listings.

All three listings below are priced at $17.69 and include free international shipping. Each listing is for a single glass (x1) and marked as multibuy so you can add more later if you want a full set.

## Why these picks work
These glasses stand out because of their decorative gold gilt and the flying pheasant motif — a classic country-core look that works for whiskey, short cocktails, or even a special beer. They’re inexpensive but distinctive, and because they’re sold individually, you can mix and match or expand your collection without committing to an expensive full set.

Below are the three options, with quick pros and notes so you can decide which fits your taste and use best.

## What to look for when you buy glassware & drinkware on a budget

Buying cheap glassware & drinkware—especially vintage or gilt-decorated pieces—can be rewarding if you know what to check. Here are practical tips to help you buy with confidence.

- Condition photos matter: Look for clear, close-up images of the rim, base, and decorative areas. Gilt wear often shows first around the rim.

- Ask about chips and cracks: Even small hairline cracks can compromise safety and longevity. If they’re not shown, ask the seller directly.

- Verify the finish: “Gold gilt” can range from heavy, raised gilding to thin painted lines. Decide what look you prefer and confirm with the seller.

- Check dishwasher safety: Vintage gilt is usually not dishwasher-safe. Plan to hand-wash and dry gently to preserve the gold detailing.

- Consider lead content: Older glassware sometimes used leaded crystal. If that’s a concern, ask the seller or limit food contact (use them primarily for display or wrapped use).

- Size and volume: If you’re matching to existing glasses or use them for specific drinks (whiskey vs. lager), check the dimensions and capacity.

- Shipping and returns: Free international shipping is a great perk, but confirm who pays return shipping if the item doesn’t match the listing.

- Multibuy advantage: These listings show “multibuy” — useful if you want to pick up multiples later. Check whether the seller offers discounts on multiple items.

## Where these glasses fit in your home

- Home bar: Use the tumblers for neat whiskey or short cocktails.  
- Dinner parties: The gold gilt adds a dressy touch to small gatherings.  
- Collector display: Single rarities like the 1970s Dema glass are nice for curio shelves.  
- Gift ideas: A single unique glass can be a charming, inexpensive present for someone who enjoys vintage style.
