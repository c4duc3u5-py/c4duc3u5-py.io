## Best Tech & Electronics Deals This Week

Find eight solid tech & electronics bargains under £40 — from a sturdy aluminium laptop stand to a ready-to-go TP‑Link Archer VR600 AC1600 modem router. Read on for exact prices, condition notes, quick specs, and buying tips so you can buy tech & electronics online UK with confidence.

### Top value pick — GOKEDA Aluminium Laptop Stand (Best for remote work)
![GOKEDA Aluminium Laptop Stand](/images/products/best-tech-electronics-deals-this-week-fe7d39/GOKEDA-Aluminium-Laptop-Stand.webp)  
[GOKEDA Aluminium Laptop Stand Ergonomic Computer Desk Stand - New](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/227204576588) — Price: £19.99 · Condition: Brand new · Shipping: see eBay listing for delivery options (calculated at checkout)

Why buy: This anodised aluminium stand is lightweight yet rigid, folding flat for day-to-day commuting. It lifts screens to a more ergonomic height (typical stands raise your screen by ~10–15cm), improves airflow under the laptop, and reduces neck strain. At £19.99 this undercuts many plastic or generic stands that sell for £25–£40, so it’s strong value for home and hybrid workers.

Specs & care: Aluminium alloy construction, non-slip rubber pads, fits 11–17" laptops, and folds to roughly 25 x 20 x 2 cm when closed (typical dimensions). Wipe with a damp cloth; avoid abrasive cleaners to keep the anodised finish intact.

What to watch for: Check weight limit in the listing and confirm it supports heavier 15–17" laptops if you use a metal-clad MacBook or gaming laptop.

### Runner-up value — Bike Phone Mount Frame Bag (Best for cyclists)
![Bike Phone Mount Frame Bag](/images/products/best-tech-electronics-deals-this-week-fe7d39/Bike-Phone-Mount-Frame-Bag.webp)  
[Bike Phone Mount Frame Bag Touch Screen MTB Road Cycling Holder - New](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/227204918144) — Price: £13.99 · Condition: Brand new · Shipping: see eBay listing for delivery options (calculated at checkout)

Why buy: A practical, weather-resistant frame bag with a touchscreen window, ideal for mapping and long rides. At £13.99 it’s cheaper than branded handlebar mounts (£20+), and adds storage for keys, cash or a mini tool kit.

Specs & care: Likely PVC or nylon construction with TPU touch window; fits most phones up to 6.5". Straps (Velcro or buckle) attach to the top tube and head tube – check width compatibility before you buy. Dry thoroughly after wet rides and avoid leaving salted road spray to prevent stitching corrosion.

What to watch for: Confirm actual dimensions on the listing if you have an oversized phone with a chunky case.

### Fun tech gift — Mr Potato Head 3D Mug (Novelty tech-adjacent)
![Mr Potato Head 3D Mug](/images/products/best-tech-electronics-deals-this-week-fe7d39/Mr-Potato-Head-3D-Mug.webp)  
[Mr Potato Head 3D Mug 7 Face Pieces Ceramic Toy Story - New in Box](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/227206341105) — Price: £15.99 · Condition: New (other) · Shipping: see eBay listing for delivery options (calculated at checkout)

Why buy: Not strictly electronics but a quirky desk accessory for anyone in tech. The ceramic 3D mug includes seven removable face pieces for customisation — perfect for a programmer’s hot drinks or as a low-cost desk gift. At £15.99 it’s cheaper than many licensed novelty mugs that retail at £20–£30.

Specs & care: Ceramic, estimated capacity ~300–350ml. Handle with care; hand-wash recommended to protect painted details and detachable pieces. Check “New (other)” note in the listing for packaging status.

What to watch for: Confirm if the pieces are dishwasher-safe (likely not) and whether the box is included if you plan to gift it.

### Networking deal — TP‑Link Archer VR600 AC1600 Modem Router (Best for cheap home broadband upgrade)
![TP-Link Archer VR600 AC1600](/images/products/best-tech-electronics-deals-this-week-fe7d39/TP-Link-Archer-VR600-AC1600.webp)  
[TP-Link Archer VR600 AC1600 Wireless Gigabit VDSL/ADSL Modem Router 1600Mbps](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/227215516428) — Price: £40.00 · Condition: Opened – never used · Shipping: see eBay listing for delivery options (calculated at checkout)

Why buy: The Archer VR600 is a dual‑band AC1600 VDSL/ADSL modem router — a sensible buy if you need an all-in-one device for FTTC (VDSL) or legacy ADSL lines. For £40 (opened but unused) this is a bargain: new units often sell between £60–£120 depending on retailer. You get better Wi‑Fi range and gigabit LAN ports compared with basic ISP-supplied routers.

Specs & care: AC1600 combined throughput (up to 1200Mbps theoretical on 5GHz + 300Mbps on 2.4GHz), VDSL2/ADSL2+ support, multiple Gigabit Ethernet ports. Keep firmware up to date via TP‑Link’s site and secure the router with a strong admin password. Avoid placing it next to large metal objects for best signal.

What to watch for: "Opened – never used" means original packaging may be unsealed. Check seller rating and return policy, and verify the included power adapter is UK‑compatible.

## Duplicate listings: more stock but check seller
There are duplicate listings for the Bike Phone Mount, GOKEDA stand and Mr Potato Head mug — same price and condition. Multiple identical entries usually mean additional stock or the same seller re-listing. That’s useful if you want a backup or gift multiple people, but check the item’s postage and combined shipping rules before buying multiples.

- Bike Phone Mount (duplicate): [link](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/227204918144) — £13.99 · Brand new.  
- GOKEDA Laptop Stand (duplicate): [link](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/227204576588) — £19.99 · Brand new.  
- Mr Potato Head 3D Mug (duplicate): [link](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/227206341105) — £15.99 · New (other).

There are also two identical TP‑Link listings at £40 (opened – never used) — good if you need spares or want to compare seller terms.

## What to look for when you buy tech & electronics on eBay UK
- Seller rating and returns: Prioritise sellers with 98%+ positive feedback and a clear returns window (at least 14 days).  
- Exact specs: For routers, confirm VDSL/ADSL, LAN port speed, and wireless bands (AC1600 means dual‑band). For stands and mounts, check physical dimensions and max load.  
- Power lead region and plug: Confirm UK plug or that a UK adapter is included, especially for routers and electronics.  
- Condition details: “Opened – never used” can be fine but check if the warranty transfers and whether serial numbers are intact. “New (other)” often means packaging may be imperfect.  
- Photos and authenticity: For branded goods like TP‑Link, compare photos with official product shots and check for firmware version or stickered model numbers.  
- Combined shipping: If buying multiple small items (mug + mount), ask the seller about combined postage to save on delivery fees.

## Care and longevity tips
- Routers: Place centrally, keep firmware current, and change default admin credentials. Reboot monthly if performance drifts.  
- Laptop stands: Wipe aluminium with a microfibre cloth; rubber feet can perish so check them periodically.  
- Bike phone mounts: Keep the touchscreen window clean for responsiveness; replace Velcro straps if they wear. Remove the phone in heavy rain unless the bag is fully waterproof.  
- Ceramic mugs: Handwash and avoid thermal shocks (no boiling straight after fridge storage).

## Quick buying checklist
- Confirm dimensions and compatibility (phone size, laptop size, broadband type).  
- Read the full eBay description and check for UK power plugs.  
- Compare delivery times and combined shipping rules.  
- Check warranty and return policy; message the seller if anything is unclear.

## Conclusion — Best overall pick and links
Best overall pick: GOKEDA Aluminium Laptop Stand at £19.99. It delivers immediate ergonomic benefit, improves cooling, and beats many basic plastic stands for durability and design.
