## [Mr Potato Head 3D Mug 7 Face Pieces Ceramic Toy Story - New in Box](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/227206341105)
![Mr Potato Head 3D Mug](/images/products/best-tech-electronics-under-40-a-buyers-guide-9f6443/Mr-Potato-Head-3D-Mug.webp)

- Price: £15.99  
- Condition: New (other)  
- Shipping: Free UK postage

Why buy: This ceramic novelty mug doubles as a collectible and everyday drinkware. The 3D moulded face pieces give it character, and the seven interchangeable parts let you mix expressions — nice for a desk that needs personality.

Key facts and care tips: The cup is ceramic (glazed finish). Typical ceramic mug size is roughly 9–11cm tall and 8–9cm diameter; expect about 300–350ml capacity. Handwash to protect the 3D parts and painted details; avoid the dishwasher and microwave if the decal or glued parts are present. The box condition and “New (other)” state mean it may be retail packaged but not from the factory sealed pallet — inspect seller photos for mint box if that matters to you.

Use case: Great as a stocking filler, desk prop, or part of a Toy Story collection. Buy this if you want something fun and usable for less than £20.

## [Bike Phone Mount Frame Bag Touch Screen MTB Road Cycling Holder - New](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/227204918144)
![Bike Phone Mount Frame Bag](/images/products/best-tech-electronics-under-40-a-buyers-guide-9f6443/Bike-Phone-Mount-Frame-Bag.webp)

- Price: £13.99  
- Condition: Brand New  
- Shipping: Free UK postage

Why buy: If you cycle with navigation, a transparent touch-screen phone bag is far superior to balancing a phone on the top tube. This holder secures to the frame with Velcro straps and protects your phone from spray and light rain while maintaining touchscreen access.

Key facts and fit: Most of these mounts fit phones up to 6.5–7.0 inches. The clear screen is usually TPU (soft plastic) with anti-scratch coating; the bag body is polyester or oxford cloth with reinforced seams. Straps are typically 3–4cm wide Velcro that fasten around tubes up to 5cm diameter. Weight is light (60–120g), so it won’t affect handling.

What to check: Confirm internal dimensions in the listing photos or description — if you have a thick case or camera bump, make sure it still fits. Check how the bag attaches: multi-point straps are more secure than single-strap designs. Look for clear seam sealing if you ride in poor weather.

Use case: Day-to-day commuting, route-following on long rides, or recording runs with a mounted camera app.

## [GOKEDA Aluminium Laptop Stand Ergonomic Computer Desk Stand - New](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/227204576588)
![GOKEDA Aluminium Laptop Stand](/images/products/best-tech-electronics-under-40-a-buyers-guide-9f6443/GOKEDA-Aluminium-Laptop-Stand.webp)

- Price: £19.99  
- Condition: Brand New  
- Shipping: Free UK postage

Why buy: A lightweight aluminium laptop stand is the quickest ergonomic upgrade for anyone working at a laptop. This model is aluminium alloy, collapsible, and raises the display 10–15cm off the desk — reducing neck strain and improving airflow.

Key facts and dimensions: Typical top platform size for these stands is around 230–270mm x 180–210mm and supports laptops up to 15.6 inches and 3kg. The aluminium surface dissipates heat better than plastic, and rubber anti-slip pads protect the laptop and desk. Folded thickness is usually 10–20mm for easy storage.

Care tips: Wipe aluminium with a microfibre cloth; avoid abrasive cleaners to keep anodised finish intact. Check for firm hinges — a loose hinge is the main fault to watch for. If the listing includes the folded dimensions, compare them to your bag if you plan to travel with it.

Use case: Home office, hybrid working, or anyone using a laptop for extended periods who needs better posture and cooling.

## [TP-Link Archer VR600 AC1600 Wireless Gigabit VDSL/ADSL Modem Router 1600Mbps](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/227215516428)
![TP-Link Archer VR600](/images/products/best-tech-electronics-under-40-a-buyers-guide-9f6443/TP-Link-Archer-VR600.webp)

- Price: £40.00  
- Condition: Opened – never used  
- Shipping: Free UK postage

Why buy: The Archer VR600 is a compact AC1600 VDSL/ADSL modem router that upgrades older ISP-supplied boxes. Dual-band Wi‑Fi (300Mbps on 2.4GHz + 1300Mbps on 5GHz) plus gigabit LAN ports make it a useful upgrade for streaming, working from home, and light gaming.

Key facts and practical checks: The VR600 supports VDSL2 and ADSL2+, has four gigabit Ethernet ports, and USB 2.0 on some revisions for basic network storage. It usually ships with external antennas (non-detachable on some hardware revisions). Make sure your ISP is compatible — the VR600 supports common UK VDSL profiles but confirm Annex A/B requirements and PPPoE vs. DHCP. “Opened – never used” means it’s out of the box but should include all accessories; check for power adapter, DSL cable, and documentation in the listing photos.

Security & setup tips: Update firmware immediately after setup and change the default admin password. Use WPA2 (or WPA3 if supported) and disable remote management unless you need it.

Use case: Replace a flaky ISP router, create a separate guest network, or extend performance for a small household.

## What to look for when buying tech & electronics under £40

- Compatibility first: Check physical dimensions, phone size fit, laptop size, and ISP compatibility (for routers). A good fit prevents returns.
- Condition and included accessories: “Brand New” vs “Opened — never used” matters. Confirm power adapters, straps, and any cables are included.
- Seller details: Look for 98%+ seller feedback and recent positive reviews. Read the returns policy and estimated dispatch time.
- Materials and build: Aluminium stands beat plastic for heat dissipation and longevity. For bike bags, reinforced seams and TPU windows last longer than cheap PVC.
- Warranty and firmware: For network kit, a seller warranty and updateable firmware are important. Ask if the seller will provide a receipt if you need a RMA.
- Care and maintenance: Ceramic mugs need handwashing for decals; aluminium stands need non-abrasive cleaning; soft TPU windows should be wiped with a damp cloth.

## Best overall pick and final recommendation

Best overall pick: TP-Link Archer VR600 AC1600 — £40.00, Opened – never used, Free UK postage. For a household that relies on stable internet, this router offers the best practical upgrade value in the list. It turns an ageing ISP box into a dual-band gigabit network, improves Wi‑Fi performance for multiple devices, and is still a sensible buy under £40 if the unit and accessories are complete.
