## Best Video Games Under £88 — A Buyer's Guide

If you want to buy video games or gaming gear in the UK without breaking the bank, these three listings are genuinely worth a look. You'll find a pair of Valve Index knuckle controllers (left and right) at sensible replacement prices, plus a brand-new copy of Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island — a heavyweight board-game experience that plays like an RPG. Read on for specific specs, why each item is worth buying, what to watch for, and my top pick.

### Why these picks matter for UK buyers
These listings cover two practical use cases: replacing damaged VR hardware (cheap video games hardware replacements) and buying a boxed game for social play. All three are priced between roughly £60–£89, are easy to buy video games online UK-style via eBay, and represent strong value compared with buying new.

## [Valve Index LEFT Knuckle VR Controller - Very Good Condition + USB-C Cable](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/227216741279)
![Valve Index LEFT Knuckle VR Controller - Very Good Condition + USB-C Cable](/images/products/best-video-games-under-88-a-buyers-guide-d33ed7/Valve-Index-LEFT-Knuckle-VR-Controller.webp)

- Price: £88.99
- Condition: Pre-owned (Very Good)
- Shipping: see eBay listing for postage options—typically tracked UK delivery

Why buy this: If you own a Valve Index headset or a SteamVR setup, buying a single left knuckle controller at £88.99 is a cost-effective way to replace a lost or damaged unit. New Index controllers are expensive when bought in pairs; a single, well-cared-for pre-owned unit restores full hand-tracking and pressure-sensitive inputs without the full price tag.

Key details and specs:
- Materials: polycarbonate/plastic shell with soft-touch finishes on the grip; fabric wrist strap with adjustable buckle.
- Connector: USB-C for charging and firmware updates.
- Features: capacitive finger sensing, grip-pressure sensors, analog stick (on right), and full SteamVR tracking compatibility (works with base stations 1.0/2.0).
- Approx. fit: ergonomic loop that wraps around the back of the hand to allow relaxed gripping and fingers-off actions.

Use cases: replacement for a damaged controller, upgrading from older Vive controllers if you already have base stations, or keeping a spare for multiplayer setups.

What to check on arrival: verify wrist strap integrity, test capacitive sensors in SteamVR (finger presence), check the USB-C charging port for wobble, and run a tracking calibration to ensure no drifting. If the seller included a recent photo, compare wear on the foam/pad and strap stitching.

Care tips: keep the fabric strap dry and avoid excessive twisting. Clean the plastic shell with a damp microfiber and 70% isopropyl if sticky residue appears. Remove battery stress by storing at ~40–60% charge for long periods.

## [Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on The Cursed Island, Portal Games 2021 New & Sealed](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/227211157162)
![Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on The Cursed Island, Portal Games 2021 New & Sealed](/images/products/best-video-games-under-88-a-buyers-guide-d33ed7/Robinson-Crusoe--Adventures-on-The-Curse.webp)

- Price: £59.99
- Condition: Brand new (sealed)
- Shipping: see eBay listing for postage options—often tracked courier or Royal Mail

Why buy this: Robinson Crusoe is a deep cooperative survival board game that plays 1–4 players and offers lengthy, narrative-driven sessions (60–120+ minutes). For £59.99 sealed, this is a strong buy for tabletop groups who want an immersive campaign-style board game.

Key details and specs:
- Contents: large game board, scenario book, dozens of cards, cardboard tokens, plastic pawns, dice, and several wooden markers. Components are high-quality cardboard with linen finish; pawns and tokens are durable ABS plastic and wood.
- Box size & weight: substantial box (roughly 30 x 30 x 8 cm) and heavy components — expect 1.5–2.5 kg depending on edition packaging.
- Edition: Portal Games 2021 printing — includes updated scenario design and improved iconography.

Use cases: great for solo play, couples who like narrative co-op, or group game nights that favour strategic, thematic experiences. The game rewards careful planning and role-play; it’s not a quick “party” title.

What to check on arrival: since this is new & sealed, confirm the seal is intact and the edition year matches 2021. Check language on the box if you need English rulebooks and verify shipping packaging for dents.

Care tips: store upright in a cool, dry place. When you open, use small zip bags or aftermarket insert trays to keep components organised — the game benefits from component sorting to speed setup.

## [Valve Index RIGHT Knuckle VR Controller - Very Good Condition + USB-C Cable](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/227216745825)
![Valve Index RIGHT Knuckle VR Controller - Very Good Condition + USB-C Cable](/images/products/best-video-games-under-88-a-buyers-guide-d33ed7/Valve-Index-RIGHT-Knuckle-VR-Controller.webp)

- Price: £88.99
- Condition: Pre-owned (Very Good)
- Shipping: see eBay listing for postage options—typically tracked UK delivery

Why buy this: The right knuckle controller is the one that includes the joystick and primary action buttons, so if yours is dead or malfunctioning, this listing restores full functionality. At £88.99 with a USB-C cable included, it’s an economical replacement that keeps your Index rig working without buying a whole kit.

Key details and specs:
- Materials: same polycarbonate outer shell and tactile button cluster; joystick is low-profile with reliable centring.
- Features: thumbstick, ABXY-style buttons (on compatible controllers), grip sensors, and pressure-sensitive triggers.
- Compatibility: SteamVR and Valve Index hardware; must be paired via SteamVR and used with base stations.

Use cases: essential part replacement, spare for multiplayer setups, or keeping a pair of controllers when one axis fails.

What to check on arrival: test the thumbstick for dead zones, confirm trigger pressure sensitivity in SteamVR Input Tester, inspect strap hardware for fraying, and run firmware update via SteamVR if needed.

Care tips: avoid gaming with sweaty hands without a sweatband; moisture accelerates wear on foam and wrist straps. Replace the wrist strap if stitching looks worn — inexpensive aftermarket straps exist.

## What to look for when you buy video games, controllers, and board games on eBay UK

- Seller feedback and returns: prioritise sellers with 98%+ positive feedback and a clear returns policy. This reduces the risk of missing parts or undisclosed damage.
- Exact condition photos: ask for close-ups of wear points — wrist strap stitching, USB-C port, joystick face, and box corners. “Very Good” on eBay can range; photos quantify it.
- Compatibility and extras: for Index knuckles, confirm you have SteamVR base stations and a compatible headset. For board games, confirm language and edition (2021 here).
- Batteries and charge cycles: controllers have internal batteries; ask the seller how long a full charge lasts and whether it holds charge after 12–24 hours idle.
- Test before finalising: request a video demo if possible — moving the controllers and showing SteamVR input readings helps detect drift or dead sensors.
- Shipping and insurance: choose tracked, insured postage — VR hardware and boxed games are fragile and valuable to replace.
- Beware of fakes: look for Valve branding, correct serial formats, and SteamVR pairing behaviour. Counterfeit controllers usually have poor fit/finish and will fail firmware paths.

## Quick care and longevity tips

- Store controllers at ~40–60% battery if not used for months to protect lithium-ion cells.
- Keep foam and wrist straps dry; spot-clean with isopropyl wipes and let fully air-dry.
- Use a hard-shell box or padded mailer when shipping or transporting to avoid drops damaging internal sensors.
- For board games, seal components in polybags and avoid heat or compression — cardboard warps with moisture.

## Best overall pick and final recommendation

My best overall pick is the Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on The Cursed Island (Portal Games 2021) at £59.99 (brand new & sealed). It gives the most immediate, reliable value: sealed components, no compatibility headaches, and excellent replayability for groups and solo players. If you need hardware instead, choose the Valve Index RIGHT Knuckle controller (£88.99, pre-owned Very Good) if your right-hand inputs or joystick are failing — it restores core playability for SteamVR systems.
