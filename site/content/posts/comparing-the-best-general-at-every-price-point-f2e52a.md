## Budget pick — practical, useful items under £20

### [Multifunctional Aluminium Alloy Portable Stand 9.5" - Brand New Boxed](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/227204571197)  
![Multifunctional Aluminium Alloy Portable Stand 9.5"](/images/products/comparing-the-best-general-at-every-price-point-f2e52a/Multifunctional-Aluminium-Alloy-Portable.webp)  
Price: £12.94 · Condition: Brand new · Shipping: see eBay listing for postage and delivery estimate.  
Why buy: Light, durable aluminium alloy and a 9.5" footprint make this ideal for phones, small tablets and lightweight e-readers. The metal construction resists flexing better than plastic alternatives.  
Trade-offs: Not suited to heavy laptops; check hinge stiffness in photos and returns policy. Foldable design means you should wipe salt or dust from hinges to avoid squeak.

### [Pheasant Tumbler Glass X1 Whiskey Glasses Retro Gold Rimmed - Multibuy](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/227215521492)  
![Pheasant Tumbler Glass](/images/products/comparing-the-best-general-at-every-price-point-f2e52a/Pheasant-Tumbler-Glass.webp)  
Price: £12.99 · Condition: Pre-owned · Shipping: see eBay listing for postage and delivery estimate.  
Why buy: Classic cut-glass tumbler with a decorative gold rim — great as a single replacement or for a vintage-inspired bar shelf. The glass body is heavy enough for cocktails and whiskey.  
Trade-offs: Pre-owned gold rims can show wear; these should be hand-washed to protect plating. Inspect seller photos for rim condition and hairline cracks before you buy.

### [Cocktail Hour | Cocktail Shaker Set - Drinks Kit - Brand New](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/227204587061)  
![Cocktail Shaker Set](/images/products/comparing-the-best-general-at-every-price-point-f2e52a/Cocktail-Shaker-Set.webp)  
Price: £15.99 · Condition: Brand new · Shipping: see eBay listing for postage and delivery estimate.  
Why buy: A compact drinks kit is a quick upgrade for home entertaining — stainless parts stay rust-free if rinsed and dried. Ideal if you want a practical bar kit without buying 12 separate tools.  
Trade-offs: Check the set contents (jigger, shaker, strainer) in the listing; cheaper kits sometimes omit a proper strainer or use thin metal that dents.

### [Boxed Set Mugs + Coasters - Beside the Seaside - New](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/227204941809)  
![Boxed Set Mugs + Coasters](/images/products/comparing-the-best-general-at-every-price-point-f2e52a/Boxed-Set-Mugs---Coasters.webp)  
Price: £15.99 · Condition: Brand new · Shipping: see eBay listing for postage and delivery estimate.  
Why buy: Ceramic mugs with themed coasters make a ready gift. Look for glazing quality and coaster backing (cork preferred).  
Trade-offs: Confirm mug capacity (typically 300–400ml) and dishwasher safety on the listing if that matters for you.

## Mid-range pick — practical kits and homeware (£21–£50)

### [UFCW Color Cutlery Set Stainless Steel Flatware Set 6 Spoon 6 Fork](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/227212807970)  
![UFCW Color Cutlery Set](/images/products/comparing-the-best-general-at-every-price-point-f2e52a/UFCW-Color-Cutlery-Set.webp)  
Price: £21.99 · Condition: Brand new · Shipping: see eBay listing for postage and delivery estimate.  
Why buy: A 12-piece stainless steel set with coloured handles adds personality to your table while resisting corrosion. Good balance between weight and durability for daily use.  
Trade-offs: Colouring is usually lacquered — expect some wear on edges over years. Dishwasher-safe claims vary; check the listing notes.

### [Portable A4 Document Scanner 1050DPI +16GB - Used (Original Box)](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/227204412900)  
![Portable A4 Document Scanner](/images/products/comparing-the-best-general-at-every-price-point-f2e52a/Portable-A4-Document-Scanner.webp)  
Price: £48.99 · Condition: Pre-owned (original box) · Shipping: see eBay listing for postage and delivery estimate.  
Why buy: A portable A4 scanner with claimed 1050 DPI and included 16GB is excellent for archiving receipts, contracts or photos. Compact size makes it useful for home office or on-the-go scanning.  
Trade-offs: Used units may need firmware updates or cable replacements; ask the seller about included software and tested functionality. High DPI is great for photos but slows scanning — expect trade-offs between speed and resolution.

## Best value pick — near-premium and hobby items (£51–£86)

### [DJI Osmo Mobile 4 - Gimbal Stabilizer](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/227215512715)  
![DJI Osmo Mobile 4](/images/products/comparing-the-best-general-at-every-price-point-f2e52a/DJI-Osmo-Mobile-4.webp)  
Price: £80.00 · Condition: Opened – never used · Shipping: see eBay listing for postage and delivery estimate.  
Why buy: A 3-axis smartphone gimbal is the best upgrade for smooth video and vlogging. The magnetic clamp system speeds up mounting and the foldable design is pocketable.  
Trade-offs: This is an opened item — verify included accessories (charging cable, magnetic ring) and test balance with your phone model. Firmware pairing is straightforward but check battery health and return rights.

### [Revell 05422 1:96 Cutty Sark Model Kit - Brand New Sealed](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/227210111091)  
![Revell Cutty Sark Model Kit](/images/products/comparing-the-best-general-at-every-price-point-f2e52a/Revell-Cutty-Sark-Model-Kit.webp)  
Price: £85.99 · Condition: Brand new (sealed) · Shipping: see eBay listing for postage and delivery estimate.  
Why buy: Revell’s 1:96 Cutty Sark is a proper ship kit for model-builders — expect plastic hull parts, detailed fittings and rigging plans. The scale yields a finished model that’s impressive on a shelf.  
Trade-offs: This is a kit — assembly, painting and rigging take time and additional tools (glue, paints, rigging thread). If you want display-ready, budget extra for paint and varnish.

## What to look for when you buy "general" items online (buying tips)

- Condition matters: For pre-owned glass, ceramics and electronics, ask for close-up photos of edges, rims, connectors and any serial/model stickers.  
- Shipping & returns: Many eBay sellers vary on postage and returns; confirm postage cost and estimated delivery to the UK postcode before you buy.  
- Materials & care: Gold-rimmed glass should be hand-washed; stainless steel cutlery benefits from immediate drying. Model kits need clamp, glue and paints — check what’s included.  
- Compatibility & model info: For the DJI gimbal, check phone weight and dimensions against the gimbal’s payload. For scanners, ensure the software works on your OS. Ask the seller for model numbers if not shown.  
- Missing parts risk: Kits and electronics listed as "opened" or "pre-owned" often lack small parts or accessories — ask for an inventory.
