## Deal Alert: 3 Collectibles at Great Prices

If you collect vintage glassware, branded kitchenware, or animal-themed barware, these three eBay finds are worth a look — each is priced between £10 and £13 and represents strong value compared with similar listings in the UK collectibles market. Read on for exact prices, condition, shipping notes, clear buying advice, and why each piece could be the best addition to your collection.

### Quick snapshot — what you’ll find
- A branded Lurpak limited‑edition toast rack in very good condition for £9.72.  
- A rare 1970s gilt flying pheasant beer/lager glass for £12.99 (New (other), single piece, multibuy available).  
- A vintage gilt pheasant whiskey glass for £12.99 (New (other), single piece, multibuy available).

## 1) Best value-for-money: Lurpak Limited Edition Douglas Toast Rack — £9.72 (Pre-owned)

[ Lurpak Limited Edition Douglas Toast Rack - Very Good Condition w/ Box ](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/227204568075)

- Price: £9.72  
- Condition: Pre-owned (Very Good Condition)  
- Shipping: See the eBay listing for the seller’s current postage rates and options.

Why this is a top value: branded promotional pieces from food brands like Lurpak are collectible because they’re limited runs and often sold in original boxes. Similar branded toast racks or small branded metalware usually sell for £15–£30 on eBay when boxed. At £9.72, this one undercuts typical prices while including its box, which preserves resale value.

What I noticed from the listing: the rack appears to be chrome- or nickel-plated metal (common with promotional toast racks) and looks straight with no visible rust or bending — important for display and use. The “Douglas” variant is a known limited edition tie-in; boxed pieces often appeal to collectors and stylists.

Use cases and care: this works as a display piece in a retro kitchen or as a practical rack for serving toast. If you plan to use it, check the plating for wear and keep it hand-cleaned with mild detergent; avoid abrasive scourers that can lift plating. For display, keep the box dry and store with acid-free tissue.

What to ask the seller: confirm exact dimensions (typical toast racks are about 12–15cm long) and whether the box has any water staining. That affects both useability and collector value.

## 2) RARE 1970s Dema Gold Gilt Flying Pheasant Beer/Lager Glass — £12.99 (New (other))

[ RARE 1970's Dema Gold Gilt Flying Pheasant Beer/Lager Glasses X1 - Multibuy ](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/227215524657)

- Price: £12.99  
- Condition: New (other) — single glass listed (multibuy available)  
- Shipping: See the eBay listing for the seller’s postage options.

Why this is worth buying: gilt-decorated 1970s barware, particularly with animal motifs like flying pheasants, is in demand for country-house styling and bar-cart collectors. Comparable vintage gilt beer glasses commonly sell for £20–£40 each, depending on condition and maker. At £12.99, this piece is competitively priced — especially if it’s described as “New (other)” (often meaning unused with light storage wear).

Material and dimensions: this is a glass pint/lagger style (expect around 12–18cm height and a 400–500ml capacity typical of lager glasses). The gilt pheasant motif is applied as a transfer or hand-gilded decal; that gold finish is decorative rather than pure gold leaf.

Care and longevity: gilt decoration will wear if run through a dishwasher. Handwash in warm water with a soft cloth and use a soft towel to dry. Avoid citrus cleaners and bleach, which can dull gilt work. If you plan to display them stacked, separate with cloth to avoid scratching the gilt.

What to check before buying: confirm whether the gilt is intact across the design and ask about any micro-crazing, chips at the rim, or storage marks. If you’re buying as a set (multibuy), ask the seller for photos showing multiple pieces side-by-side for consistent pattern quality.

Why the price is good now: single gilt vintage glasses often appear at higher prices because they’re sold as collectible decor. Given the niche appeal and condition listed as “New (other),” this is a reasonable buy for collectors or for gifting to someone who likes retro country décor.

## 3) Vintage pheasant whiskey glass, gold gilt country core — £12.99 (New (other))
![Vintage pheasant whiskey glasses gold gilt country core - x1 - Multibuy](/images/products/deal-alert-3-collectibles-at-great-prices-2850b3/Vintage-pheasant-whiskey-glasses-gold-gi.webp)

[ Vintage pheasant whiskey glasses gold gilt country core - x1 - Multibuy ](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/227215528118)

- Price: £12.99  
- Condition: New (other) — single whiskey glass (multibuy available)  
- Shipping: See the eBay listing for the seller’s postage options.

Why this appeals: whiskey glasses with gilt animal motifs are staples for country or hunting-lodge aesthetics. Typical vintage single whiskey tumblers with gilt work can sell from £15 to £35 each. At £12.99, you're getting a collectible piece at the lower end of market pricing, especially if it’s unused.

Material and probable specs: likely clear glass with a gold-gilt decal of a pheasant — expect a tumbler of around 8–10cm height and 200–300ml capacity. The “country core” styling is popular for themed gift sets and home bars.

Care tips: treat gilt-decorated tumblers as delicate. Handwash only, avoid soaking for long periods, and dry immediately. If you plan to use them for spirits, keep liquids away from the gilt rim on repeated use to prolong decoration.

What to verify: request close-up photos of the rim, base, and gilt design. Look for mold lines, manufacturing marks, or the Dema maker mark (if present) to help identify authenticity and era. Check for microchips on the rim which can be hidden in photos.

## Buying tips: what to look for and what to avoid when buying cheap collectibles on eBay UK
- Condition matters more than price for long-term value. Small chips, gilt wear, and plated metal flaking drastically reduce resale and display appeal. Always request close-up photos if current images are small.  
- Ask about dimensions and weight — postage on fragile glass can be expensive; knowing weight helps you estimate shipping cost.  
- Look for maker marks/hallmarks. A Dema or maker’s label will boost collectibility and typically command higher prices.  
- Watch for "New (other)" wording: it often means unused but may have storage marks. That’s fine for display, but if you’re buying to use (drinking or dining), confirm the hygiene and storage history.  
- Multibuy listings can be a way to build a set. If a seller offers multibuy discounts, ask for combined shipping to save money.  
- Care: gilt decoration — always handwash. Metal/plated pieces — avoid aggressive polishes; use a soft cloth and specialist metal cleaner only if needed.

## Seasonal relevance and soft urgency
These items are small and often sold one-off. Listings in the £10–£13 bracket move fast because they appeal to both decorators and bargain hunters. If you want a matched set, the multibuy option for the glass listings is worth checking now — the seller may only have a handful of pieces left.

## Best overall pick and final recommendation
Best overall pick: Lurpak Limited Edition Douglas Toast Rack — £9.72 (Pre-owned). It offers the strongest immediate value: a branded, boxed item for under £10 that typically sells higher when boxed and in very good condition. If you collect branded kitchenware or want a retro-serving piece, this is the standout bargain.
