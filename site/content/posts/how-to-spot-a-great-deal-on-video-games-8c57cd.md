## How to Spot a Great Deal on Video Games and VR Gear (and Save Time & Money)

A good deal on video games or VR hardware means getting reliable performance, clear seller info, and fair shipping — not just a low price. This guide shows how to evaluate listings on eBay.co.uk, what to inspect in VR controllers and board games, and three vetted listings in the £60–£89 range you can check right now.

I’ll cover practical checks (condition, compatibility, battery health), red flags, and care tips. If you want to buy video games, buy video games online UK, or upgrade your Valve Index kit, these steps stop buyer’s remorse before it starts.

### Why learning this saves time and money
Knowing what to look for avoids returns and nasty surprises. For electronics, the price difference between a working pre-owned Valve Index controller and one needing repairs is huge. For board games, a sealed copy keeps component value and playability intact.

## Quick picks in the £60–£89 range (with links and images)

- [Valve Index RIGHT Knuckle VR Controller - Very Good Condition + USB-C Cable](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/227216745825)  
  Price: £88.99 — Condition: Pre-owned (Very Good) — Shipping: check the listing for postage cost and estimated dispatch.  
  ![Valve Index RIGHT Knuckle VR Controller - Very Good Condition + USB-C Cable](/images/products/how-to-spot-a-great-deal-on-video-games-8c57cd/Valve-Index-RIGHT-Knuckle-VR-Controller.webp)  
  Why buy: Right-hand Index Knuckle controller gives precise finger tracking via capacitive sensors and an adjustable fabric strap for a secure fit. The controller body is high-impact ABS plastic with a tracking ring that needs to be intact for lighthouse tracking. The listing includes a USB-C cable for charging and firmware updates via SteamVR — important for compatibility. Pick this if you’re replacing a lost right controller or building a single-handed spare.

- [Valve Index LEFT Knuckle VR Controller - Very Good Condition + USB-C Cable](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/227216741279)  
  Price: £88.99 — Condition: Pre-owned (Very Good) — Shipping: check the listing for postage cost and estimated dispatch.  
  ![Valve Index LEFT Knuckle VR Controller - Very Good Condition + USB-C Cable](/images/products/how-to-spot-a-great-deal-on-video-games-8c57cd/Valve-Index-LEFT-Knuckle-VR-Controller.webp)  
  Why buy: Left-hand Index Knuckle controller complements the right for full hand-tracking. Important features to verify: functioning analog stick, face buttons, and intact tracking ring with no cracks. This listing includes a USB-C cable and is a good buy when priced under £100 — replacement controllers new are significantly more expensive.

- [Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on The Cursed Island, Portal Games 2021 New & Sealed](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/227211157162)  
  Price: £59.99 — Condition: Brand New (Sealed) — Shipping: check the listing for postage cost and estimated dispatch.  
  ![Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on The Cursed Island, Portal Games 2021 New & Sealed](/images/products/how-to-spot-a-great-deal-on-video-games-8c57cd/Robinson-Crusoe--Adventures-on-The-Curse.webp)  
  Why buy: This is a heavyweight cooperative survival board game with high-quality cardboard components, wooden tokens, plastic miniatures, and scenario-driven campaign content. New & sealed copies maintain component integrity and resale value. At £59.99 for a 2021 Portal Games release, it’s a solid buy if you want a complex campaign game for 1–4 players (approx. 120–180 minute sessions).

## Step-by-step checklist for evaluating video games and VR controllers on eBay UK

1. Seller reputation and returns  
   - Prioritise sellers with 99%+ positive feedback and recent sales of similar items.  
   - Check the returns window and whether postage is covered for returns.

2. Photos and close-ups  
   - For electronics: look for detailed pictures of the tracking ring, USB-C port, straps, and any visible wear.  
   - For board games: clear photos of the sealed shrinkwrap, UPC/stickers, and box corners.

3. Functionality statements  
   - Listings that say “functions perfectly” or mention recent firmware updates are better.  
   - If a listing lacks functional details, message the seller to confirm charging status and pairing behaviour.

4. Included accessories  
   - Controllers: USB-C cable, strap, and original packaging are bonuses.  
   - Board games: sealed box is ideal; if used, check for missing components and replacement policies.

5. Shipping and dispatch speed  
   - Fast dispatch reduces waiting time and signals a professional seller.  
   - Confirm whether the item is shipped from the UK to avoid customs delays.

## What to look for specifically with Valve Index Knuckle controllers

- Tracking ring condition: examine photos for hairline cracks or deformation. Cracks affect Lighthouse tracking reliability.  
- Strap and fabric: straps should be intact, adjustable, and not frayed. The strap tension mechanism must hold.  
- USB-C port and cable: ensure the port isn’t loose and the included USB-C cable charges the controller. This listing explicitly includes a USB-C cable, which saves you buying one separately.  
- Button/joystick responsiveness: ask the seller to confirm the analogue stick returns to centre and that all face buttons register.  
- Firmware and pairing: ask whether the controller pairs with SteamVR and if it accepts firmware updates. A working device should update via your PC.  
- Battery health: used Index controllers have internal Li-ion batteries. Ask if the seller has observed rapid discharge or swelling. If health is unknown, budget for possible future replacement.

Why these details matter: Valve Index controllers use capacitive finger sensors and lighthouse tracking — anything that impairs sensing (cracked ring, loose port) directly degrades VR presence and game performance.

## What to look for with board games (Robinson Crusoe example)

- Sealed vs used: a brand-new sealed copy preserves minis, punchboards, and high-quality thick cardboard components.  
- Box condition and edition: Portal Games 2021 edition often includes updated components and errata; confirm the edition if you care about print quality.  
- Shipping protection: board game boxes can dent easily — ensure the seller uses sturdy packing or corner protectors.  
- Player count and playtime: Robinson Crusoe is a long-form cooperative; make sure the time investment (120–180 minutes per game) fits your group.

## Care tips after purchase

- For controllers: store in a dry place at roughly 40–60% battery if you’re not using them frequently. Avoid leaving Li-ion batteries fully charged for weeks.  
- Keep firmware up to date via SteamVR and recalibrate the finger sensors after major updates.  
- For board games: open sealed copies carefully with a box cutter along the shrinkwrap edges to avoid damaging the box. Use plastic sleeves for cards if you plan repeated plays.

## Common mistakes to avoid when you buy video games or VR controllers on eBay UK

- Buying on pictures alone: lack of detailed close-ups or vague condition terms (“tested”) is a red flag.  
- Ignoring return policy: sellers who don’t accept returns put you at risk if the item fails to work on arrival.  
- Overlooking compatibility: Valve Index controllers require SteamVR lighthouse tracking — they don’t natively work with inside-out tracking without adapters or SteamVR support.  
- Skipping cable inclusion: missing USB-C cable forces extra purchases and delays testing.

## Short FAQ: pairing and compatibility

- Can Valve Index controllers work with non-Index headsets? Yes — they operate through SteamVR tracking. They’re best paired with Lighthouse base stations.  
- Do pre-owned controllers need a factory reset? Not always — but re-pairing via SteamVR and updating firmware is standard practice after buying used.

## Best overall pick and final recommendation

Best overall pick: [Valve Index RIGHT Knuckle VR Controller - Very Good Condition + USB-C Cable](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/227216745825) and [Valve Index LEFT Knuckle VR Controller - Very Good Condition + USB-C Cable](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/227216741279) — buy both if you need a matched pair for full hand tracking. At £88.99 each (Pre-owned, Very Good) they’re priced below the cost of new replacements and include a USB-C cable to get you testing immediately. Shipping details are on each listing page — confirm postage and dispatch times before purchase.

For a tabletop recommendation, [Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on The Cursed Island, Portal Games 2021 New & Sealed](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/227211157162) at £59.99 (Brand New) is the best pick if you want a long, immersive cooperative campaign with durable components and high replay value.
