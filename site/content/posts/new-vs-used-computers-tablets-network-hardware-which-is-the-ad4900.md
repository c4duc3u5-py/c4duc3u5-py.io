## New vs Used Computers, Tablets & Network Hardware: Which Is the Better Deal?

If you're shopping in the computers, tablets & network hardware category on a budget, there are solid options both new and pre-owned. Small accessories and peripherals often do just as well used, while routers and scanners may benefit from buying new or lightly used with a return window. Below I compare four real listings in the $14–$67 range so you can decide what to buy now, whether you want cheap stands, a portable scanner, or a reliable router.

## Budget pick: tiny stands that do a lot for $13–$18

If you need a simple stand or a small improvement to your desktop setup without spending much, both of the low-cost options are worth considering.

- [Mecha Stand For Amazon Echo Dot 4 & Apple HomePod Mini - Orange - Opened Unused](https://www.ebay.com/itm/227204904735) — $13.61  
  This is a cheap, lightweight stand designed for smart speakers. It’s listed as opened but unused, which often means you get the item in like-new condition. Perfect if you want to tidy up a nightstand, raise your Echo Dot 4 for better mic pickup, or add a splash of color.

- [Multifunctional Aluminium Alloy Portable Stand 9.5" - Brand New Boxed](https://www.ebay.com/itm/227204571197) — $17.63  
  A metal, foldable stand is one of the most practical cheap buys. It works for tablets, small laptops, and even as a makeshift second-screen stand. Brand-new and boxed at under $18 makes this a low-risk, high-value purchase.

Tradeoffs: At this price range you’re buying convenience and small ergonomics upgrades rather than durability or premium materials. If you want something sturdy for long-term heavy laptop use, step up to a sturdier stand — but for portable use and occasional desk setups these are great cheap computers, tablets & network hardware accessories.

## Mid-range pick: value and versatility

Both budget options are cheap, but the aluminium stand is the better mid-range pick thanks to being brand new and more versatile. At $17.63 it sits squarely in the sweet spot for people who want quality without overspending.

Why choose the aluminium stand?
- Lightweight and portable for travel or working from cafes.
- Metal construction usually outlasts plastic alternatives.
- Compatible with tablets and smaller laptops — helpful for tablets & network hardware users who need a steady viewing angle.

If your priority is a tidy, portable workstation for a tablet or lightweight laptop, this accessory beats spending more on a decorative stand.

## Premium picks: scanner and router — different kinds of value

For $50–$67 you can move into items that materially change what you can do: fast scanning or stronger home networking.

- [Portable A4 Document Scanner 1050DPI +16GB - Used (Original Box)](https://www.ebay.com/itm/227204412900) — $66.73  
  A 1050 DPI portable A4 scanner with included 16GB storage is a specialist tool. For anyone who needs to digitize paperwork, receipts, or books while on the move, this is a very practical buy. Being pre-owned usually keeps cost down, but this listing ships internationally for free and comes in its original box — a sign the seller preserved the item well.

  Tradeoffs: Used electronic scanners can show wear (feed rollers, sensors). Check the seller’s return policy and ask about tested status if it’s critical for professional use. For occasional personal scanning, this saves hundreds versus buying new.

- [TP-Link Archer VR600 AC1600 Wireless Gigabit VDSL/ADSL Modem Router 1600Mbps](https://www.ebay.com/itm/227215516428) — $54.49 (+$4.07 delivery)  
  This is the networking pick. TP-Link’s Archer VR600 supports both VDSL/ADSL and AC1600 Wi‑Fi speeds, making it a solid choice for many home or small-office setups. Buying new (even “new other”) reduces the risk you assume with used routers — firmware issues, previous ISP locks, or degraded performance.

  Tradeoffs: It’s not the top-of-the-line router for gamers or heavy multi-user households, but at this price it offers excellent bang for the buck compared with higher-end consumer routers. If you need a modern mesh or Wi‑Fi 6 solution, you’d need to spend more.

## Used vs new: a short guide for computers, tablets & network hardware

- Buy used when: the item is non-critical, has replaceable parts, or is an accessory (stands, speaker stands, many peripherals). Used saves most on items that don’t have firmware security concerns.
- Buy new when: the device handles your network (routers) or stores personal data (phones, tablets), or when warranty and firmware updates are important. Routers often benefit from being new or certified refurbished to avoid hidden issues.
- Inspect listings: photos, seller rating, tested status, return policy, and shipping terms are crucial. Free international shipping is a perk on several of these listings; factor delivery time into your decision.

## Quick buying tips

- If you’re assembling a portable workstation: buy the aluminium stand first, then add the Mecha or other speaker stand if you use a smart speaker.
- If you need reliable home internet on a budget: the TP-Link Archer VR600 is a pragmatic network hardware pick — supports ADSL/VDSL and decent Wi‑Fi speeds.
- If you scan occasionally but want decent quality: the Portable A4 Scanner at $66.73 is worth it if you need paper-to-digital regularly.

## Final recommendation

For the cheapest fix that still improves daily comfort, grab the [Mecha Stand For Amazon Echo Dot 4 & Apple HomePod Mini - Orange - Opened Unused](https://www.ebay.com/itm/227204904735) at $13.61 or the [Multifunctional Aluminium Alloy Portable Stand 9.5" - Brand New Boxed](https://www.ebay.com/itm/227204571197) at $17.63. If you need real functionality — either better home networking or portable scanning — the [TP-Link Archer VR600 AC1600 Wireless Gigabit VDSL/ADSL Modem Router 1600Mbps](https://www.ebay.com/itm/227215516428) at $54.49 (+$4.07 delivery) and [Portable A4 Document Scanner 1050DPI +16GB - Used (Original Box)](https://www.ebay.com/itm/227204412900) at $66.73 are the smarter investments.
