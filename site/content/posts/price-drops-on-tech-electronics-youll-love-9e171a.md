## Price Drops on Tech & Electronics You'll Love

If you’re hunting for smart deals on tech & electronics — from a practical home router to a niche VR replacement part and an unusual collectible mug — this roundup points you straight to three live eBay listings worth checking. I’ll show you why each price is interesting (or eyebrow-raising), what to inspect before you buy, and how to get the most value from each purchase.

## Best value first: TP-Link Archer VR600 AC1600 modem-router — $1.00 (New - other)
![TP-Link Archer VR600 AC1600 Bezdrátový gigabitový VDSL/ADSL modemový router 1600Mbps](/images/products/price-drops-on-tech-electronics-youll-love-9e171a/TP-Link-Archer-VR600-AC1600-Bezdr-tov--g.webp)

- Link: [TP-Link Archer VR600 AC1600 Bezdrátový gigabitový VDSL/ADSL modemový router 1600Mbps](https://www.ebay.com/itm/227215516428)  
- Price: $1.00  
- Condition: Nový (jiný) — new (other)  
- Shipping: calculated at checkout (see listing)

Why this is the best value-for-money pick
- The Archer VR600 is an AC1600-class VDSL/ADSL modem-router: dual-band Wi‑Fi (2.4 GHz + 5 GHz) delivering up to 1600 Mbps aggregate (typically 300 Mbps on 2.4 GHz + 1300 Mbps on 5 GHz). It’s rare to see functional, new networking hardware at $1; typical retail for similar TP‑Link models ranges from $70–$140.
- Built-in modem functionality saves you ISP rental fees; gigabit Ethernet ports mean wired devices get full-speed LAN performance.

What I checked and what to watch for
- Condition says “Nový (jiný)” — that often means new but possibly bundled or missing certain accessories. Confirm box contents: power adapter, RJ11 modem cable, Ethernet cable, quick start guide, and any warranty card.
- Verify firmware version and ISP compatibility (VDSL profiles vary by country). Ask the seller whether it’s unlocked for use with your ISP or set to a specific region.
- Look for external antenna count and the number of LAN ports if you need multiple wired connections (this model usually has gigabit LAN x4 and an RJ11 VDSL port).

Quick care and setup tips
- When you receive it, perform a factory reset and update firmware from TP‑Link’s website before connecting to your network.
- Place the router on a raised surface, away from microwaves and thick walls, to maximize 5 GHz coverage.
- If you depend on ISP voice services, confirm whether this unit supports your provider’s VoIP profile.

Why buy now
- $1 new is effectively a no-brainer if the seller confirms full accessories and warranty. Listings like this are often single-quantity and move fast, so check the listing and message the seller for confirmation.

## Collector curiosity: 3D Mr Potato Head ceramic mug, 7-piece face set — $44,601.00 (New - other)
![3D hrnek Mr Potato Head 7 kusů obličeje keramický příběh hraček - nový v krabici](/images/products/price-drops-on-tech-electronics-youll-love-9e171a/3D-hrnek-Mr-Potato-Head-7-kus--obli-eje.webp)

- Link: [3D hrnek Mr Potato Head 7 kusů obličeje keramický příběh hraček - nový v krabici](https://www.ebay.com/itm/227206341105)  
- Price: $44,601.00  
- Condition: Nový (jiný) — new (other)  
- Shipping: calculated at checkout (see listing)

Why this listing stands out (and why to be cautious)
- The product is a ceramic 3D Mr Potato Head mug with seven removable facial pieces — a novelty item that’s clearly collectible, made of glazed ceramic with painted details and packaged “new in box.”
- However, $44,601 is far outside normal market ranges for licensed ceramic mugs (which usually retail for $15–$60). This price suggests either a rare collectible, a misentered listing, or a private-sale pricing strategy.

Buying tips for high-priced collectibles
- Ask the seller for provenance: original receipts, limited-edition certificates, or serial numbers. High-value listings should include clear provenance and photos of the box, tags, and any manufacturer markings.
- Inspect photos for crazing, hairline cracks, chip evidence, and box condition. Even mint ceramics can lose value if the box shows wear.
- Verify the seller’s feedback, return policy, and whether shipping will be insured and tracked. For items at this price point, insist on full insured delivery.

Care guidance if you buy
- Ceramic mugs with applied pieces should be hand-washed and handled gently; repeated dishwasher cycles can loosen glued components or fade paint.
- Store in the original packaging and avoid direct sunlight to prevent glaze discoloration.

Why you might still click
- If this truly is a rare promotional piece or signed limited edition, the listing could be authentic. But treat it as a serious collectible purchase: ask for more detail, then decide.

## Niche repair part: Index ventilů VR ovladač levého kloubu — $2.00 (Used)
![Index ventilů VR ovladač levého kloubu - velmi dobrý stav + kabel USB-C](/images/products/price-drops-on-tech-electronics-youll-love-9e171a/Index-ventil--VR-ovlada--lev-ho-kloubu.webp)

- Link: [Index ventilů VR ovladač levého kloubu - velmi dobrý stav + kabel USB-C](https://www.ebay.com/itm/227216741279)  
- Price: $2.00  
- Condition: Použitý — used (very good condition)  
- Shipping: calculated at checkout (see listing)

Why this is worth a look
- This is a replacement part for a Valve Index (or related) VR controller: “Index ventilů VR ovladač levého kloubu” literally points to the left joint assembly of a controller plus a USB‑C cable. At $2, it’s effectively pay-for-shipping territory for a potentially expensive-to-repair device.
- Replacement joints and connectors can save you $50–$150 compared to buying used controllers or paying repair shops.

What to verify before buying
- Confirm exact compatibility: Valve Index, Knuckles, or third‑party controller models differ. Ask the seller for model numbers, part IDs, or photos of the mating connectors.
- Check the USB‑C cable length and whether it’s data-capable (some cheap cables charge only). Test port integrity for loose pins or bent contacts.
- Ask about return options if the part doesn’t fit; small parts are often final sale.

Repair and installation tips
- If you’re comfortable opening the controller, use an anti‑static mat and keep screws organized. Take photos during disassembly to make reassembly easier.
- Inspect ribbon cables and contact pads for wear — sometimes the cable or PCB pads are the real problem, not the joint.
- Calibrate the controller after installation and run the SteamVR controller diagnostic to ensure button/axis consistency.

Why buy now
- Low-cost replacement parts appear infrequently and can disappear quickly. At $2 plus shipping, even if it’s a gamble, the upside for repairers is high.

## What to look for when you buy tech & electronics (practical buying tips)
- Condition matters more than price: “New (other)” can mean close to new but missing accessories. Always ask for a full itemized list of what’s included.  
- Check firmware and regional compatibility: routers and some electronics can be locked or configured for specific ISPs or regions. Ask about factory reset and firmware updates.  
- Inspect photos closely for physical wear: look at seams, connectors, label legibility, box condition, and any scratches or discoloration.  
- Shipping and returns are part of the price: factor in insured shipping and potential import taxes. For high-value collectibles, require tracked and insured delivery.  
- For replacement parts (ventilů, ovladač, levého kloubu), confirm exact part numbers and test functionality immediately after receipt.
