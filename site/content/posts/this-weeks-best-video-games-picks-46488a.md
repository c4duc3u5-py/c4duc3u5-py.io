## This Week's Best Video Games Picks — VR controllers and a top-rated board game under £90

Find three standout video games and accessories priced between £60–£89 on eBay UK this week: two Valve Index knuckle (left/right) controllers for building or fixing a Valve Index setup, and a Brand New copy of Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island for board-game sessions. If you want to buy video games, VR gear, or tabletop experiences online in the UK, these listings are solid options to consider right now.

### What you'll get from this roundup
- Two pre-owned but Very Good Valve Index Knuckle controllers (Left and Right), each at £88.99 — useful if you need replacements or want spare controllers.  
- One Brand New Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island (Portal Games, 2021) at £59.99 — an immersive cooperative board game for 1–4 players.  
- Practical buying tips for used VR controllers and new board games, care guidance, and a clear recommendation at the end.

## [Valve Index LEFT Knuckle VR Controller - Very Good Condition + USB-C Cable](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/227216741279)
![Valve Index LEFT Knuckle VR Controller](/images/products/this-weeks-best-video-games-picks-46488a/Valve-Index-LEFT-Knuckle-VR-Controller.webp)

Price: £88.99  
Condition: Pre-owned (Very Good)  
Shipping: See eBay listing for current shipping and delivery options

Why this is notable: the Index Knuckle controllers (left) are the best way to get full finger tracking with SteamVR content. This left-hand unit includes a USB-C cable for charging and firmware updates, and the seller describes it as Very Good — meaning minor cosmetic wear but fully functional buttons, grip sensors and strap. The controller uses a polycarbonate shell with a soft-touch foam strap and capacitive sensors for finger tracking, plus the analog grip button that lets you naturally hold virtual objects.

Why buy: perfect as a replacement for a lost or broken left controller, or if you need a spare for multiplayer setups or repairs. Works with Valve Index base stations and most SteamVR setups that support knuckle-style controllers.

Quick expert notes: check that the strap mechanism and magnetic clip are intact; verify the seller’s test notes or ask for a brief video of the controller pairing with SteamVR before purchase. Keep firmware updated via Steam to avoid tracking glitches.

## [Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on The Cursed Island, Portal Games 2021 New & Sealed](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/227211157162)
![Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on The Cursed Island](/images/products/this-weeks-best-video-games-picks-46488a/Robinson-Crusoe--Adventures-on-The-Curse.webp)

Price: £59.99  
Condition: Brand New (Sealed)  
Shipping: See eBay listing for current shipping and delivery options

Why this is notable: Robinson Crusoe is a heavyweight cooperative board game known for its tough scenarios, rich thematic components and replayability. The 2021 Portal Games edition comes with high-quality cardboard, thick player mats, wooden resource tokens, multiple scenario booklets and a detailed rulebook — all factory-sealed in the box.

Why buy: great value for a sealed copy at £59.99 — typically a retail price range for new copies in the UK. Ideal for groups who like scenario-driven survival gameplay and variable difficulty. The box is reasonably sized (roughly A4 square footprint, about 8–10cm deep), so it stores alongside other modern hobby titles.

Care and use tips: once opened, sleeve the cards (standard Euro size) to preserve resale value and prevent edge wear. Keep wooden tokens and components in small resealable bags to avoid rubbing and damage. If you plan to play solo, read the scenario setup carefully — some campaigns run 1.5–2 hours each.

## [Valve Index RIGHT Knuckle VR Controller - Very Good Condition + USB-C Cable](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/227216745825)
![Valve Index RIGHT Knuckle VR Controller](/images/products/this-weeks-best-video-games-picks-46488a/Valve-Index-RIGHT-Knuckle-VR-Controller.webp)

Price: £88.99  
Condition: Pre-owned (Very Good)  
Shipping: See eBay listing for current shipping and delivery options

Why this is notable: this is the right-hand counterpart to the left controller above. Buying matching left and right knuckles from the same seller or same condition is smart — it reduces the odds of mismatched wear or battery performance. The right controller shares the same build: polycarbonate housing, soft strap, capacitive finger sensors, and USB-C charging.

Why buy: if one side of your Index kit has failed or shows tracking drift, replacing just the right controller can restore full functionality for a fraction of the price of a new set. It’s also sensible for modders and repairers who salvage parts like the silicone strap, PCB or sensors.

Practical check before purchase: request a photo of the serial number sticker and ask whether the controller has had any battery replacements. Testing in SteamVR is best, but if the seller can provide a short pairing demo video that shows the tracking LED and trigger response, that’s a good sign.

## What to look for when you buy used VR controllers (expert checklist)
- Cosmetic condition: superficial scuffs are fine; deep cracks in the housing or snapped straps are not.  
- Strap and latch: the soft strap and its magnetic clip should hold comfortably and lock securely; a worn strap affects comfort and safety.  
- Charging port and cable: confirm the included USB-C cable charges the unit; bent ports are a red flag.  
- Buttons and sensors: ensure triggers, thumbstick, grip and capacitive finger sensors respond. Ask for a short video of the controller in SteamVR showing tracking lights and button presses.  
- Battery health: older controllers may need a battery swap; ask if the seller has replaced the battery or offers a return if battery life is poor.  
- Firmware and pairing: controllers should update via Steam. Ask whether the controller pairs to a fresh Steam account.  
- Returns and postage: prefer sellers with UK returns or a clear returns window. Factor in shipping cost to your final price.

## Buying tips for board games on eBay UK
- Verify edition and language: confirm the rulebook is English (Portal Games typically prints English boxes, but always check).  
- Sealed vs. opened: sealed is best for collectors; opened but complete can be cheaper if components are bagged and boxed carefully.  
- Shipping protection: buy from sellers who double-box or provide tracked postage; board game boxes dent easily in transit.  
- Component care: sleeve cards and bag wooden pieces after opening. For long-term storage, keep the game in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight.

## Care and maintenance for Valve Index controllers
- Clean with a soft microfiber cloth and a 70% isopropyl wipe for the areas players touch. Avoid getting moisture into seams.  
- Keep straps dry; sweat can degrade foam over time — use disposable face covers or a silicone cover if you sweat heavily.  
- Store partially charged; lithium batteries prefer not to sit at 0% or 100% long-term. Charge to about 50% for long storage.  
- Update firmware via Steam regularly to maintain compatibility and tracking stability.

## Comparison — Best for different needs
- Best for replacement parts / repairs: Valve Index LEFT and RIGHT Knuckle controllers (£88.99 each). Buying one side can get a broken Index back into action quickly.  
- Best for social/co-op play and value: Robinson Crusoe (Brand New, £59.99) — delivers hours of campaign content and is ready to play straight from the sealed box.  
- Best for collectors: Robinson Crusoe sealed copy — keeps retail value and is safe from wear if you plan to resell later.

## Final recommendation — Best overall pick
Best overall pick: Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on The Cursed Island — Brand New & Sealed at £59.99. For the money, you get a complete, high-quality board game that supports solo or group play and will provide many hours of gameplay. It’s priced under the £60–£89 window and arrives new, which removes the variable risks of buying used electronics.

If you specifically need VR hardware, buy the matching pair of Valve Index knuckle controllers only if you can verify battery and tracking functionality; at £88.99 each they’re a reasonable route back to full finger-tracked VR without sourcing an entire new system.
