## Top 3 Books & Media Picks for Every Budget

If you want solid picks across the full spectrum — from a $1 media steal to a high-end collector's set and an unexpected tech accessory — these three eBay listings cover practical use, collecting value, and display-grade presentation. Below you'll find exact prices, conditions, shipping notes, images, and hands-on buying advice so you can decide which Books & Media pick fits your shelf, budget, or gift list.

### 1) Hliníkový stojan na notebook GOKEDA ergonomický počítačový stolní stojan — nový
![Hliníkový stojan na notebook GOKEDA ergonomický počítačový stolní stojan - nový](/images/products/top-3-books-media-picks-for-every-budget-28732c/Hlin-kov--stojan-na-notebook-GOKEDA-ergo.webp)  
[Hliníkový stojan na notebook GOKEDA ergonomický počítačový stolní stojan - nový](https://www.ebay.com/itm/227204576588)  
Price: $55,758.00 — Condition: Zcela nový — Shipping: calculated at checkout; see eBay listing for details.

Why it's worth buying: this is a solid-aluminum ergonomic notebook stand built for long-term desk use and display. The GOKEDA unit is marketed as a metal (hliníkový) stand, which gives it good rigidity, an upscale finish, and increased heat dissipation compared with plastic stands. For people who spend hours on a laptop or want a premium desktop presentation for a 13–17" notebook, aluminum stands improve typing angle and screen height while keeping cables tidy.

Key features & specifics: aluminum construction (anodized or brushed finish), fixed or multi-angle riser design, anti-slip pads on the feet and top surface, ventilation-friendly profile that helps passive cooling. Footprint is typically compact — plan for roughly a 25 x 22 cm base and a riser height range that lifts screens to 10–25 cm above desk level (confirm exact dimensions on the listing).

Pros: premium materials resist long-term warping, stable base for heavier laptops, attractive on a shelf or studio desk.  
Cons: listed price is at collector/retailer level; verify warranty and return policy. This is a buy for someone seeking a durable, permanent workstation upgrade or a high-end showroom piece.

Practical uses: home office, studio display for a secondary workstation, store display for laptops or tablets. Care tip: wipe with a microfiber cloth and a 50/50 water–isopropyl solution to remove fingerprints; avoid abrasive cleaners that remove anodizing.

### 2) Inspector Morse Complete Collection DVD Box Set + 33 Magazines — Very Good
![Inspector Morse Complete Collection DVD Box Set 33 Magazines - Very Good](/images/products/top-3-books-media-picks-for-every-budget-28732c/Inspector-Morse-Complete-Collection-DVD.webp)  
[Inspector Morse Complete Collection DVD Box Set 33 Magazines - Very Good](https://www.ebay.com/itm/227204377810)  
Price: $1.00 — Condition: Použitý (Used) — Shipping: calculated at checkout; see eBay listing for details.

Why it's worth buying: at $1 this is a near-risk-free grab for fans of classic British mysteries or media collectors looking to fill gaps in a DVD library. The set pairs a full television series box set with 33 related magazines — that combo can be valuable for reference, nostalgia, or resale if the discs and periodicals are intact.

Key features & specifics: multi-disc DVD set covering the Inspector Morse episodes; magazines likely vintage press or tie-ins (check photos for titles and issue dates). For DVDs, check region coding (Region 1 vs. Region 2) and disc condition (scratches, playback tested). For magazines, inspect for completeness: stapled spines, cover creases, and any tearing or water damage.

Pros: incredible price-to-content ratio; good for sampling the series or creating a curated media shelf.  
Cons: used condition means you must confirm disc playability and magazine legibility. The seller lists the set as Very Good, but request close-up photos of disc surfaces and magazine edges before purchasing.

Buying tip: ask the seller to confirm that all DVD discs play in a standard player and whether any issues (skips, menu problems) have been observed. For magazines, ask about year ranges and whether there are any missing pages.

Care & storage: store DVDs vertically in a cool, dry spot and keep magazines flat in archival sleeves if you want to preserve them.

### 3) Harry Potter Books 1–3 Hardback Boxed Set (1998) — Good Condition
![Harry Potter Books 1-3 Hardback Boxed Set Trilogy 1998 - Good Condition](/images/products/top-3-books-media-picks-for-every-budget-28732c/Harry-Potter-Books-1-3-Hardback-Boxed-Se.webp)  
[Harry Potter Books 1-3 Hardback Boxed Set Trilogy 1998 - Good Condition](https://www.ebay.com/itm/227206323595)  
Price: $83,651.00 — Condition: Použitý (Used) — Shipping: calculated at checkout; see eBay listing for details.

Why it's worth buying: first-era hardback boxed sets of Harry Potter can command collector-level prices, especially older printings or first UK/US editions. This 1998 hardback boxed set for Books 1–3 is a display-ready trilogy that appeals to serious collectors, gift buyers, or investors in modern first editions.

Key features & specifics: three hardcover volumes in a slipcase/box, likely with dust jackets and original art. Typical single-volume dimensions for these editions are about 15 x 23 cm (6 x 9 in) with sewn bindings. Condition is listed as Good — expect shelf wear on the box, light spine creasing, or minor scuffs to jackets.

Pros: iconic titles in a single boxed presentation; strong shelf presence and potential long-term value if the edition is desirable.  
Cons: the price places this in the rare/collector market — verify edition statements, printing numbers, and presence of first-edition identifiers. A high price with "Good" condition should be scrutinized for completeness (no marked pages, original dust jackets intact, no repairs).

Collector tips: request photos of the title pages, copyright pages, and any publisher identifiers (first printing lines). Check for inscriptions, ex-library stamps, or repairs — these affect value. If you plan to read them, consider whether you want to break the box set out (which can reduce resale value) or keep them as a display piece.

Care & preservation: keep in a stable, low-humidity environment (40–50% RH), out of direct sunlight to prevent jacket fading. Store vertically on a bookshelf with bookends to prevent leaning, or keep in an acid-free archival box for long-term preservation.

## What to look for when buying Books & Media (practical tips)

- Edition details matter: for books, check the copyright page, printing number line, and publisher location to confirm whether it's a first/early printing. Sellers often photograph these — if not, ask before purchase.
- Condition terms are specific: "Good" often means visible wear; "Very Good" means minor defects. For high-value items, request close-up photos of corners, spine tips, and dust jackets.
- Media compatibility: DVDs have region codes and may not play on all players. Ask the seller to confirm Region 1 (US) vs. Region 2 (UK) and whether discs were tested recently.
- Completeness is king: boxed sets should include all discs, inserts, booklets, and any interior slippage pieces. Missing booklets or discs can dramatically reduce value.
- Shipping & packaging: demand bubble-wrap, rigid boxes, or archival mailers for books. For DVDs, insist on disc sleeves inside sturdy packaging. For expensive collector items, require signature confirmation and insurance.
- Authenticity & provenance: if a price seems unusually high (or low), ask for provenance — receipts, earlier auction records, or the seller's reason for selling. High-end Harry Potter sets often have specific identifying marks.
- Ask for return policy details: especially for used items, ensure you have a short window to verify condition upon arrival.
