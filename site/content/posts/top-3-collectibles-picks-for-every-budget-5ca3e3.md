## Top 3 collectibles picks for every budget: excellent finds at £10–£13

Find three of the best collectibles to buy right now in the £10–£13 range — a limited-edition Lurpak toast rack and two vintage gilt pheasant glasses — all ideal if you want cheap collectibles that still look special. These picks work for display, gifting, or adding character to a home bar or kitchen cabinet, and they’re all collectibles for sale in the UK with buy options on eBay.

Quick shopping note: these are low-price, single-item listings (two marked “multibuy”), so check seller photos and postage details on each eBay page before purchasing.

## 1) Lurpak Limited Edition Douglas Toast Rack — good boxed condition

![Lurpak Limited Edition Douglas Toast Rack](/images/products/top-3-collectibles-picks-for-every-budget-5ca3e3/Lurpak-Limited-Edition-Douglas-Toast-Rac.webp)

- Link: [Lurpak Limited Edition Douglas Toast Rack - Very Good Condition w/ Box](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/227204568075)  
- Price: £9.72 — Condition: Pre-owned — Shipping: see eBay listing for current postage options

Why it's worth buying
- This is a niche branded kitchen collectible. Lurpak promotional pieces have a following among collectors of advertising ephemera and vintage kitchenware.
- The item comes with its original box, which significantly improves resale and display value compared with loose pieces.
- Good condition for under £10 is rare for boxed limited editions — useful for display on a shelf or used as a functional toast rack in occasional service.

What to notice before you buy
- Material and finish: most Lurpak toast racks of this era are chrome-plated or stainless-steel alloy with lacquered branding. Look closely at seller photos for pitting, lacquer lifting, or rust around joins.
- Dimensions and capacity: typical toast racks hold 4–6 slices and are about 15cm long by 10cm high. Confirm exact measurements on the listing if you plan to use it rather than display it.
- Box condition matters: minor scuffs on the box are acceptable, but crushed corners or missing inserts reduce collector value.

Care and use tips
- If you plan to use it for food, clean gently — warm soapy water and a soft cloth; avoid abrasive pads that remove plating or gilt.
- For display, keep out of direct sunlight to prevent any printed branding on the box from fading.

Why this makes a good buy
- At £9.72 with box and reasonable condition, it’s a low-risk entry into branded kitchen collectibles and a conversation piece for a vintage-themed kitchen or shop display.

## 2) Vintage pheasant whiskey glasses – gold gilt, single x1 (multibuy)

![Vintage pheasant whiskey glasses gold gilt country core - x1 - Multibuy](/images/products/top-3-collectibles-picks-for-every-budget-5ca3e3/Vintage-pheasant-whiskey-glasses-gold-gi.webp)

- Link: [Vintage pheasant whiskey glasses gold gilt country core - x1 - Multibuy](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/227215528118)  
- Price: £12.99 — Condition: New (other) — Shipping: see eBay listing for postage and multibuy options

Why it's worth buying
- These are classic country-style whiskey glasses decorated with a gilt flying pheasant motif — desirable for collectors of gamebird glassware and for those building a themed drinks cabinet.
- New (other) condition usually indicates unused but possibly old stock; this preserves the gilt decoration better than heavily handled vintage pieces.
- Sold as x1 with multibuy available, so you can buy a matching set without committing to multiple items at once.

Material and dimensions
- Typical construction: pressed glass with applied or painted gold gilt banding and transfer-printed pheasant motif. Expect a lowball/whiskey glass size of around 7–9cm height and 200–300ml capacity — check the listing for exact measurements.
- The gilt is decorative and delicate; it’s not dishwasher-safe.

Use cases and display ideas
- Ideal as a single statement glass for a rustic bar trolley or as part of a matched set when you multibuy the listing.
- Works well for staged photographs or pub-themed decor where authenticity and visual charm matter more than daily durability.

Care tips
- Handwash only with a soft cloth and mild detergent. Avoid soaking for long periods to prevent gilt degradation.
- Store upright in a lined cabinet; avoid stacking.

Why this item stands out
- For £12.99 you get a visually striking, collectable glass that pairs well with hunting-lodge, country-cottage, or vintage bar themes. The option to multibuy lets you assemble a set affordably.

## 3) RARE 1970s Dema gold gilt flying pheasant beer/lager glass — x1 (multibuy)

![RARE 1970's Dema Gold Gilt Flying Pheasant Beer/Lager Glasses X1 - Multibuy](/images/products/top-3-collectibles-picks-for-every-budget-5ca3e3/RARE-1970-s-Dema-Gold-Gilt-Flying-Pheasa.webp)

- Link: [RARE 1970's Dema Gold Gilt Flying Pheasant Beer/Lager Glasses X1 - Multibuy](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/227215524657)  
- Price: £12.99 — Condition: New (other) — Shipping: see eBay listing for postage and multibuy discounts

Why it's worth buying
- Dema glassware from the 1970s with gold gilt decoration is collectible; the flying pheasant motif is particularly sought after by country and sporting collectors.
- The “rare” labeling suggests limited supply; at £12.99 a piece it’s an attractive price for a single, collectible beer/lager glass.
- Multibuy availability makes it sensible to buy one for display and add more for a functional set later.

Materials, size and features
- Typical Dema glasses are moulded pressed glass with a gilt transfer. Expect a lager glass profile about 12–15cm tall and 300–400ml capacity — verify the listing for exact dimensions.
- Gilt condition: check for flaking or wear; “New (other)” often means pristine decoration but confirm via detailed photos.

Practical uses
- Excellent as a standout glass for pale ales or lager in a home bar. Also useful as a prop for themed events or retail displays.
- A single rare piece can anchor a shelf of related pheasant or sporting collectibles.

Care and preservation
- Avoid dishwashers; handwash and dry immediately. Use microfibre to minimise incidental abrasion.
- If you plan to use the glass for drinking, avoid citrus or high-acid beverages that can accelerate gilt wear.

## What to look for when buying cheap collectibles online (practical tips)

- Check condition photos closely. For metal items, look for corrosion, plating loss, weld cracks, and dents. For gilt glass, zoom for flaking or scratches.
- Ask the seller for exact measurements. Many listings omit height or diameter — those numbers determine whether an item is functional for your needs.
- Confirm provenance and markings. Branded items (Lurpak, Dema) often have stamps or labels that verify authenticity. Ask for close-up photos of marks.
- Inspect packaging details. Original boxes (even with wear) increase value more than loose pieces, especially for limited editions.
- Multiples and multibuy: if you’re buying glasses intended as a set, use multibuy listings to get matched production runs — colour and gilt vary between runs.
- Shipping and returns: low-cost collectibles can be uneconomic to return, so prefer sellers with clear return policies and tracked postage within the UK.
- Care and intended use: if you plan to drink from gilt glasses, accept that the decoration will fade with use. For long-term preservation, buy for display only.

## Best overall pick and final recommendation

My best overall pick: the [Lurpak Limited Edition Douglas Toast Rack - Very Good Condition w/ Box](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/227204568075) at £9.72. It combines brand interest, original packaging, and functional display value at under £10 — a strong buy for collectors in the UK looking to start or expand a themed kitchenware collection.

Other great options depending on your focus:
- For barware and decorative drinking glasses, choose the [Vintage pheasant whiskey glasses gold gilt - x1 - Multibuy](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/227215528118) (£12.99) or the [RARE 1970's Dema gold gilt flying pheasant beer/lager glass - x1 - Multibuy](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/227215524657) (£12.99).
