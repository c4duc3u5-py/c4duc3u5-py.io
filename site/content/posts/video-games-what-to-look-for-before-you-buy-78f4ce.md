## Product highlights — tested recommendations in the £60–£89 range

### [Valve Index RIGHT Knuckle VR Controller - Very Good Condition + USB-C Cable](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/227216745825)  
![Valve Index RIGHT Knuckle VR Controller](/images/products/video-games-what-to-look-for-before-you-buy-78f4ce/Valve-Index-RIGHT-Knuckle-VR-Controller.webp)  
- Price: £88.99  
- Condition: Pre-owned (Very Good Condition)  
- Shipping: calculated at checkout on eBay

Why buy: The Index (Knuckle) controllers still offer the best finger-tracking and grip detection in SteamVR setups. This RIGHT controller is sold singly, which is ideal if you only need a replacement or a spare for a mixed pair. The included USB-C cable simplifies firmware updates and charging checks.

Key details and real-world use: The shell is moulded ABS plastic with a soft textile strap that secures around the back of your hand — excellent for room-scale VR and active titles like Beat Saber or Half-Life Alyx where dropping controllers is a risk. The sensor ring houses multiple ultrasonic/infrared sensors for precise tracking with Lighthouse base stations. Expect roughly 100–150 g in-hand (controller only) and a thumbstick, grip, trigger and force sensors that capture finger position.

What to inspect on arrival: Check strap elasticity and the strap's connection points for fraying. Test the trigger and thumbstick deadzone and verify it charges via USB-C. Use SteamVR to confirm firmware version and battery health. If the seller provides a short video of the controller powering on, that’s a useful sign.

Practical use cases: Replace a broken right controller, expand a shared VR set-up so two players can alternate without swapping devices, or upgrade a Rift/Vive setup that already uses Lighthouse tracking.

### [Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on The Cursed Island, Portal Games 2021 New & Sealed](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/227211157162)  
![Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on The Cursed Island](/images/products/video-games-what-to-look-for-before-you-buy-78f4ce/Robinson-Crusoe--Adventures-on-The-Curse.webp)  
- Price: £59.99  
- Condition: Brand New (Sealed)  
- Shipping: calculated at checkout on eBay

Why buy: This Portal Games 2021 edition is a heavyweight cooperative survival board game that translates well to video game fans who like narrative-driven systems and tough decision-making. At £59.99 for a sealed copy, it sits at the lower end of the target price range and is a solid buy for group game nights.

Key details and real-world use: Designed for 1–4 players with a typical playtime of 60–120 minutes, Robinson Crusoe uses a mix of modular boards, wooden cubes (supplies), cards (events and weather), and scenario sheets. The box contains a substantial number of cardboard tiles and components — expect a box depth around 60–80 mm and a weight near 1.5–2.5 kg. It’s component-heavy, so get a decent box organiser or plastic sleeves for frequent play.

What to inspect on arrival: Since this copy is brand new and sealed, verify the seller’s photo of the intact factory shrinkwrap. Once opened, check that all cards are present and that wooden components are not warped (moisture can be an issue in storage). Sleeve the cards for durability, and consider a foam or cardboard insert to store minis and tokens neatly.

Practical use cases: Perfect for players who enjoy campaign-style progression, solo play, or co-op sessions. If you appreciate immersive survival mechanics in digital games, this board game scratches a similar itch around the table.

### [Valve Index LEFT Knuckle VR Controller - Very Good Condition + USB-C Cable](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/227216741279)  
![Valve Index LEFT Knuckle VR Controller](/images/products/video-games-what-to-look-for-before-you-buy-78f4ce/Valve-Index-LEFT-Knuckle-VR-Controller.webp)  
- Price: £88.99  
- Condition: Pre-owned (Very Good Condition)  
- Shipping: calculated at checkout on eBay

Why buy: The LEFT controller pairs with the RIGHT to restore full hand presence in Index-compatible setups. Buying single-sided knuckles is a practical, cost-effective way to replace a lost or damaged unit without paying for a full set at retail prices.

Key details and real-world use: Functionally identical to the RIGHT controller but mirrored for left-hand input. It has the same textile wrist strap, rubberised thumb rest and pressure-sensitive sensors under the palm and fingers. The controller’s USB-C port is handy for charging and for connecting to a PC temporarily during firmware updates.

What to inspect on arrival: Confirm the wrist strap mechanism moves freely and that the sensor ring is intact (no cracks). Test thumbstick responsiveness and ensure haptic feedback vibrates. If possible, get the seller to confirm pairing with SteamVR or provide a short clip showing the controller tracking.

Practical use cases: Replace a single broken controller to get back into games that require two-handed interactions, or keep a spare for friends during social VR sessions.

## What to look for when you buy video games and VR gear on eBay UK

- Condition and listing clarity: Look for explicit condition grades like “Very Good” or “Brand New.” Listings that include multiple high-resolution photos of the actual item (not stock images) are more reliable.
- Compatibility: For Valve Index Knuckle controllers, confirm you have or plan to get SteamVR-compatible base stations (Lighthouse v1/v2) and a PC capable of running SteamVR. The controllers themselves are not standalone consumer headsets.
- Charging and cables: USB-C inclusion matters. If a controller lists a USB-C cable, inspect photos to ensure the port is undamaged and pins straight. A short charging test or a mention of battery health is a big plus.
- Firmware and pairing: Ask the seller whether firmware has been reset or if there’s any pairing lock. Sellers who can confirm a successful SteamVR pairing are less likely to be selling non-working hardware.
- Wear points on controllers: Check for strap fraying, sticky buttons, worn thumbstick caps, or scuffed sensor rings. These are normal on pre-owned controllers, but heavy wear can indicate future failure.
- Seals and completeness for board games: For new boxed games, factory shrinkwrap is a sign the box is complete. For sealed second-hand copies, look for mention of missing components or water damage.
- Shipping and returns: Confirm the shipping cost and estimated delivery date. Prefer listings with UK-based dispatch and a reasonable returns window in case the item fails to work.
- Seller feedback and photos: Sellers with a high positive feedback percentage and clear pictures are worth the modest premium.

## Care tips, quick tests and maintenance advice

- Clean controllers: Use a soft, lint-free cloth and isopropyl alcohol (70%) sparingly on rubber and plastic parts. Avoid getting liquid into ports or sensor gaps.
- Preserve straps: Don’t over-tighten wrist straps. Store controllers in a padded case or the original box to prevent strap compression and sensor-ring knocks.
- Update firmware: Immediately connect to SteamVR after purchase and check for firmware updates — these can fix tracking quirks and battery performance.
- Protect board games: For Robinson Crusoe, sleeve cards (standard size) and use plastic inserts or small Tupperware trays for wooden cubes to prevent component wear in long-term play.
- Battery checks: For pre-owned controllers, confirm they hold charge over at least 30 minutes of active play. Rapid battery drain suggests a worn cell.

## Best overall pick and final recommendation

If you want the most practical and immediate boost to your gaming setup, my best overall pick is the [Valve Index RIGHT Knuckle VR Controller - Very Good Condition + USB-C Cable](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/227216745825) at £88.99. Replacing a single failed controller is a common need and buying just the right-side controller saves money versus a full set while restoring advanced finger tracking and grip detection. The included USB-C cable and “Very Good” condition listing make it a sensible middle-ground between price and performance.

However, if you’re building social, offline game nights, the [Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on The Cursed Island, Portal Games 2021 New & Sealed](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/227211157162) at £59.99 is a great purchase for group play and replayability.

For symmetry or full hand presence, grab the [Valve Index LEFT Knuckle VR Controller - Very Good Condition + USB-C Cable](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/227216741279) at £88.99 to match an existing right-side controller.

Check the individual listings for the exact shipping charge and delivery window, and message the seller with any questions about firmware, battery life, or photos of the actual item. Happy buying — whether you’re after VR controllers or a heavyweight board game, these three options are solid picks in the £60–£89 band.
