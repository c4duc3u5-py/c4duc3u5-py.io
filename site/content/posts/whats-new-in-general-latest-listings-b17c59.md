## What's New in General — Latest Listings

There are 21 "General" listings right now across a huge price span ($1–$83,651). Below I picked eight notable finds across homeware, hobby, and tech so you can quickly see what’s worth buying, what to avoid, and where bargains hide. Each item includes price, condition, shipping note, and a short, practical take on why it might belong in your cart.

### [Cocktail Hour | Sada koktejlových šejkrů - Nápojová sada - Zbrusu nová](https://www.ebay.com/itm/227204587061)  
![Cocktail Hour | Sada koktejlových šejkrů](/images/products/whats-new-in-general-latest-listings-b17c59/Cocktail-Hour---Sada-koktejlov-ch--ejkr.webp)  
Price: $44,601.00 — Condition: Zcela nový (brand new) — Shipping: calculated at checkout (see listing)  
This luxury cocktail set stands out because of its presentation and apparent high-end finish (likely plated stainless steel or copper). It’s worth buying if you’re a collector or setting up a premium bar display; check for exact materials (stainless vs. copper plating), capacities of the shaker parts, and whether it includes a strainer and jigger. Red flag: the six-figure markup versus typical bar sets — verify seller feedback and provenance before committing.

### [DJI Osmo Mobile 4 - Gimbal stabilizátor](https://www.ebay.com/itm/227215512715)  
![DJI Osmo Mobile 4](/images/products/whats-new-in-general-latest-listings-b17c59/DJI-Osmo-Mobile-4.webp)  
Price: $2.00 — Condition: Nový (jiný) — Shipping: calculated at checkout (see listing)  
A near-zero price for a legit DJI OM4 is uncommon; this one is listed as “new (other).” The OM4 is a lightweight, foldable phone gimbal with a magnetic clamp, ActiveTrack, and up to ~15 hours runtime in normal use. Why buy: massive value if the item is authentic and complete (charger, magnetic ring). What to check: serial number, included accessories, and that firmware updates register with the DJI app.

### [Sada barevných příborů UFCW nerezová sada příborů 6 lžic 6 vidliček](https://www.ebay.com/itm/227212807970)  
![Sada barevných příborů UFCW nerezová sada příborů](/images/products/whats-new-in-general-latest-listings-b17c59/Sada-barevn-ch-p--bor--UFCW-nerezov--sad.webp)  
Price: $61,336.00 — Condition: Zcela nový — Shipping: calculated at checkout (see listing)  
This stainless steel colored flatware set (6 spoons, 6 forks) appears marketed as collectible or limited edition. Material is likely 18/10 stainless; colored handles may be resin or coated stainless. Why consider it: if you need coordinated tableware for display or a premium dining set. Watch for plating wear and confirm handle material — colored coatings can chip and are harder to repair than solid stainless.

### [Sada hrnků + tácků v krabici - vedle moře - nové](https://www.ebay.com/itm/227204941809)  
![Sada hrnků + tácků v krabici - vedle moře](/images/products/whats-new-in-general-latest-listings-b17c59/Sada-hrnk----t-ck--v-krabici---vedle-mo.webp)  
Price: $44,601.00 — Condition: Zcela nový — Shipping: calculated at checkout (see listing)  
A boxed set of cups and saucers with a seaside motif — likely glazed ceramic. Good buy if you value matching gift-ready sets; check mug capacity (typically 200–350 ml), box condition, and vitrification (microwave/dishwasher safety). If the set is porcelain, it’s more fragile but resists staining; earthenware will be heavier and more rustic.

### [Revell 05422 1:96 modelářská sada Cutty Sark - zbrusu nová zapečetěná](https://www.ebay.com/itm/227210111091)  
![Revell 05422 1:96 Cutty Sark](/images/products/whats-new-in-general-latest-listings-b17c59/Revell-05422-1-96-Cutty-Sark.webp)  
Price: $2.00 — Condition: Zcela nový — Shipping: calculated at checkout (see listing)  
Revell’s Cutty Sark 1:96 kit is a large plastic model—at that scale the finished hull runs roughly 65–70 cm—designed for experienced modelers due to rigging complexity. Why buy: exceptional value for a sealed kit if all parts and instructions are present. What to check: box seal integrity, presence of decals, and whether you’ll need aftermarket rigging thread or photo-etched parts for higher fidelity.

### [Lot - soubor stojanů na parní lokomotivy - modely vlaků](https://www.ebay.com/itm/227215531962)  
![Lot - stojany na parní lokomotivy](/images/products/whats-new-in-general-latest-listings-b17c59/Lot---stojany-na-parn--lokomotivy.webp)  
Price: $1.00 — Condition: Použitý — Shipping: calculated at checkout (see listing)  
A $1 starting price for used loco display stands is perfect for modelers and restorers. Likely metal or wood bases sized for OO/HO or O scale; check base dimensions and whether the felt or brass inserts are present. Why buy: great for stabilizing delicate models during painting/repair. What to avoid: bent mounts, missing screws, or stands that are too wide/narrow for your models.

### [Sada barev Warhammer Age of Sigmar Stormcast Eternals - otevřená - kompletní](https://www.ebay.com/itm/227204419061)  
![Warhammer Age of Sigmar paints](/images/products/whats-new-in-general-latest-listings-b17c59/Warhammer-Age-of-Sigmar-paints.webp)  
Price: $41,811.00 — Condition: Použitý — Shipping: calculated at checkout (see listing)  
This looks like a complete, opened set of Citadel-style paints for Stormcast Eternals. Pots are typically 12 ml acrylics; essential if you paint infantry with metallics, shades, and layering colors. Why it’s notable: full paint palettes save mixing time and ensure consistent tonality across a force. Check for dried-out pots, sealed lids, and whether contrast or technical paints are included.

### [Přenosný skener dokumentů formátu A4 1050DPI +16GB - použitý (originální krabice)](https://www.ebay.com/itm/227204412900)  
![Přenosný skener A4 1050DPI](/images/products/whats-new-in-general-latest-listings-b17c59/P-enosn--skener-A4-1050DPI.webp)  
Price: $1.00 — Condition: Použitý — Shipping: calculated at checkout (see listing)  
An A4 portable scanner at 1050 DPI with 16GB storage is useful for archiving documents and photos on the go. Look for AC/USB power options, TWAIN/driver compatibility with Windows/Mac, and whether the unit produces color TIFF or high-quality JPEGs. Why buy: compact digitization without needing a desktop scanner; verify scan speed and if calibration sheets are included.

## What to look for — practical buying tips

- Verify the seller and feedback for high-priced or odd-price items (that $44k cocktail set and $61k flatware are outliers). High value listings should include provenance, serial numbers, or certificates.  
- For "sada" (sets), confirm complete counts and that all pieces match (especially for tableware and paints). Missing items drastically lower value.  
- For electronics (DJI OM4, scanner): test serial/firmware authenticity, make sure chargers and mounting hardware are included, and check return policy.  
- For model kits and hobby items: inspect seals, decal sheets, and instruction presence; 1:96 ship kits may need additional rigging supplies.  
- Care tips: stainless steel flatware — rinse and dry promptly to avoid spotting; ceramic mugs — avoid thermal shock; acrylic paints — store lids tight and upside down to reduce skinning.  
- If you buy clothing or intimate items from general listings (e.g., searching for podprsenka), always check measured sizing charts, return policy, and hygiene seals.

## Comparison — best for different needs

- Best for mixology/display: Cocktail Hour shaker set (if authentic and you want a showpiece).  
- Best value tech pick: DJI Osmo Mobile 4 at $2 (verify authenticity).  
- Best for modelers: Revell Cutty Sark 1:96 kit — scale and detail.  
- Best bargain hobby kit: Lot of locomotive stands at $1 — great for repairs and displays.

## Best overall pick

My best overall pick is the [DJI Osmo Mobile 4 - Gimbal stabilizátor](https://www.ebay.com/itm/227215512715) at $2.00 (Condition: Nový (jiný)). If the listing is genuine and complete, you get a modern, compact smartphone stabilization platform for a fraction of retail—high utility and low risk if you verify serial and accessories.
