If you're refreshing a home bar or hunting for a standout gift, vintage-inspired glassware is an easy way to add character. Right now there are a few eye-catching pheasant-themed pieces listed that mix retro charm with practical use. These are affordable, collectible, and great for whiskey, beer, or as decorative accents — especially if you like gold-rimmed details.

Below are three current listings in the same price bracket that are worth a look. Each is listed at £17.69 and ships internationally for free. I’ve included the exact eBay links so you can buy glassware & drinkware directly.

### What to expect from these picks
These glasses share a common aesthetic: gold gilt decoration and a pheasant motif that reads vintage or mid-century country-chic. They work well as whiskey tumblers, small beer glasses, or display pieces. Because they mix decorative flair with everyday function, they’re a good way to update a bar cart without spending much. If you’re searching for cheap glassware & drinkware that still looks special, these are solid options.

## Quick buying guide: choosing the right glass
- If you want a dedicated whiskey experience, choose a tumbler-shaped glass (like the Pheasant Tumbler Glass listing). The wide bowl and solid base make it easier to swirl and nosh on bitters.
- For beer and lager lovers, the slightly taller Dema beer/lager glass will give the head room and shape suited to ale aromas.
- If collecting or gifting, consider condition and rarity. “New (Other)” can be a sweet spot — older style, but still crisp.
- Always check for gilt wear and small chips on vintage pieces. A close-up photo or message to the seller can confirm condition.
