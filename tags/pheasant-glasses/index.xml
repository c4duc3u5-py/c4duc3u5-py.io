&lt;p&gt;Finding statement pieces for your bar or kitchen doesn’t have to cost a lot. These three vintage-style pheasant glasses bring personality, a touch of gold gilt, and genuine mid-century charm — all at a budget-friendly price. They’re great if you collect unique glasses, want a single replacement piece, or are building a matched set gradually with multibuy listings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three listings below are priced at $17.69 and include free international shipping. Each listing is for a single glass (x1) and marked as multibuy so you can add more later if you want a full set.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
