&lt;p&gt;If you want useful tech &amp;amp; electronics that actually improve your day without breaking the bank, these four picks — from a novelty mug to a full VDSL modem router — are worth a look. Each item is priced between £14 and £40, ships from the UK seller on eBay, and is ready to solve a specific problem: better posture, safer cycling, a fun desk cup, or faster home broadband.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Computers, Tablets &amp; Network Hardware: New vs Used Deals</title><link>https://c4duc3u5-py.github.io/c4duc3u5-py.io/computers-tablets-network-hardware-new-vs-used-deals/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 19:05:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://c4duc3u5-py.github.io/c4duc3u5-py.io/computers-tablets-network-hardware-new-vs-used-deals/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="new-vs-used-computers-tablets--network-hardware-which-is-the-better-deal"&gt;New vs Used Computers, Tablets &amp;amp; Network Hardware: Which Is the Better Deal?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re shopping in the computers, tablets &amp;amp; network hardware category on a budget, there are solid options both new and pre-owned. Small accessories and peripherals often do just as well used, while routers and scanners may benefit from buying new or lightly used with a return window. Below I compare four real listings in the £14–£67 range so you can decide what to buy now, whether you want cheap stands, a portable scanner, or a reliable router.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Best Computers, Tablets &amp; Network Hardware Deals This Week</title><link>https://c4duc3u5-py.github.io/c4duc3u5-py.io/best-computers-tablets-network-hardware-deals-this-week/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 19:04:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://c4duc3u5-py.github.io/c4duc3u5-py.io/best-computers-tablets-network-hardware-deals-this-week/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="best-computers-tablets--network-hardware-deals-this-week"&gt;Best Computers, Tablets &amp;amp; Network Hardware Deals This Week&lt;/h2&gt;
